            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56580:9"/> third out of the ſecond, the fourth out of the third.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The firſt and indeed the root of all the reſt, is this, that there be in a man a principle of ſaving faith, cloſing with Chriſt to ſecure the preſent and finall eſtate of the ſoule, or the ground-work of ſound Regeneration and converſion to God; there may be many workings or gifts of the Spirit of God in and unto men, in whom there is not a ſpirit uniting to Chriſt, and there is a dogmaticall faith of holding the truth in opinion and aſſent which is not juſtifying of the perſon by reception of Chriſt; now there muſt be ſuch a ſpirit, and ſuch a faith as may carry the ſoule out of it ſelf for ſubſiſtence, and above it ſelf in operation and working, ſo that God may be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, from whom and unto whom the ſoule doth act, and then it will follow, that hee that hath caſt his ſoule on Chriſt by faith, ſecuring the mayn eſtate thereof, ſhall the more eaſily caſt away his life, eſtate, &amp;c. in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular cauſe for him. Hee that through all the pangs and ſtruglings of the new-birth, diſcouragements at the weight and height of his ſin, oppoſitions of reaſonings, deluſions, and flatteries of ſelf-righteouſneſſe, violence of hell it ſelf, hath ſhot the mayn gulf and hath landed in Chriſt, ſhall with more facility lay aſide his leſſer, his outward intereſts for him, for it is a terrible thing for the ſtouteſt heart alive to look ſuch a danger in the face, as for ought hee knows may at one blow kill him and damne him, or in a moment, ſend him both to his grave and Hell, it makes a man follow the Lord ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he obeyes the Commandement by the ſame faith, whereby hee receives the ſaving promiſe, and offers up <hi>Iſaac</hi> by the ſame faith, whereby hee got him; that is, to obey and ſuffer by a juſtifying faith, as they, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. whoſe acts there expreſſed, were
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56580:10"/> not moſt of them juſtifying acts, yet done by a ſaving and juſtifying faith, for ſo it is the ſame hand which ſhuts and cloſes upon the gift and opens it ſelf to work. And yet I muſt needs preoccupate an Objection, and grant that <hi>Abraham</hi> who believed the mayne promiſe without ſtaggering, ſhewed ſome trepidation, when he conceived himſelf in danger of his life, <hi>They will kill me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 12. 12.</note> ſaith he; but that is but the encountring of ſence with faith, which ſence fights ſore againſt faith, when it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it's own dunghil, I mean in a ſenſible danger, natures retraction of it ſelfe from a viſible feare may cauſe the pulſe of a Chriſtian which beats truly and ſtrongly in the mayn point, <hi>the ſtate of the ſoule,</hi> to intermit and faulter at ſuch a time; but the Needle will return to the true point again upon ſelf-recollection, <hi>That godlineſſe hath the Promiſes that belong to this life and the life to come:</hi> as for ſuch men whoſe hearts are not ballaſt with grace; no marvell if they ride uncertainly and are up and down in rough water, for though in fair and eaſie wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they may keep tune and time, yet it will be no wonder if they ring their bels backward when things begin to be on fire, <hi>Religio religat,</hi> Godlineſs binds faſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The ſecond is, That a man affect God himſelfe, and account him his great reward, and this is the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate effect of ſaving grace and faith, to bring the ſoule into the eſteem and acceptance of God himſelf for our <gap reason="foreign">

And <hi>bleſſed are the people that are in ſuch a caſe,</hi> Pſal. 144. 15. but the main Promiſe of the Covenant is, <hi>I will be their God and they ſhall be my people;</hi> and then ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Ibid.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56580:10"/> Yea bleſſed are the people whoſe God is the Lord:</hi> That which we call <hi>amor amicitiae</hi> or <hi>conjugalis</hi> cloſes with the perſon, and not onely with benefits. The firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement ſhews that this is the moſt naturall order; firſt; to have God for our God, and then and thence to performe other duties. Servility when one is awed from ſin, or driven to duties by the whip, and merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries when one is drawne by meere benefit or reward, are the bane of following the Lord fully: He that parts with ſin as a ſlave, parts with it and loves it, and will in the calme gather up again that which he caſt over-board in the ſtorm; and he will perform duties and hate them: He that follows God as a mercenary will no longer <hi>uti Deo,</hi> then he can <hi>frui mundo:</hi> He will uſe him while he can ſerve himſelf of him. Duties and ſufferings are irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome things without that <hi>ſuave condimentum,</hi> the love of God himſelfe. I know the opinion of merit with God or men ſweetens ſharpe duties and ſufferings to ſome palats, but that is but <hi>dulce venenum,</hi> a ſweet poyſon to all we do, it fruſtrates our very Faſts, <hi>Did yee</hi>

                     <hi>at all Faſt unto me, even unto me?</hi> Was it not an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an excellent ſpirit in <hi>Moſes,</hi> when God offered him the benefit without himſelf or his preſence, <hi>Exod. 33. 2. I will ſend an Angell before thee, and I will drive out the Canaanites, &amp;c.</hi> but <hi>I will not go up in the midſt of thee;</hi> and this was the reaſon, I ſhall but <hi>conſume</hi> thee if I do; what a faire offer was this, and what a reaſon of Gods deniall of his own preſence was that, and yet <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> could not be content with it; <hi>For if thy preſence goe</hi>

                  <p n="3">3 The third is, To value Gods intereſts in any buſines
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56580:11"/> under our hand, more then our owne, his Goſpell, his cauſe, his glory; and this riſes out of the former; for he that loves God himſelfe, above himſelfe, will value Gods intereſt above his own. It is the property of a ſincere heart to obſerve, what ſhare God may have in any action or duty to which hee is called, and to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and abſtract it from his own.

                  <p n="4">4 The fourth is, To be able to periſh for God, and this riſes out of the former, for he onely can lay himſelf

Let no man ſay, <hi>Paul</hi> thou muſt hunger and be abaſed, it is a matter of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nay, but yee ſee he makes it a point of ability in him, that he can be in a neceſſitous condition; a man ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be quiet nor at point, till hee can loſe himſelf to ſave himſelf, as Chriſt ſpeaks, and periſh to live, for he ſhall be daunted at every alarum of ill tydings, fearfull of the ſhadow of the Croſſe, every danger in a duty awes him; every frown of a great man daſtards him, untill he can periſh in his reputation, and be vile, more vile, yet more vile for God, or can come to that, <hi>They would not</hi>

                  <p>I come to the ſecond thing, <hi>viz.</hi> what it is <hi>to fulfill after the Lord,</hi> or who may be ſaid to do? And this I ſhall briefly run through.</p>
                  <list>

                  <p n="1">1 For the more generall explication of this point, <hi>To fulfill after the Lord.</hi> 1 Excludes partiality in the Law of God and takes in integrity. Patiality is either in the negative part of the Law, and that is when a man caſts off ſome ſins, &amp; hath ſome other, one at leaſt, <hi>in deliciis;</hi> or in the affirmative part; when he plows here, &amp; makes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56580:12"/> a bawke there, this cannot be following fully, for that conſiſts in integrity of averſion from ſin, and of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to God, <hi>quoad aſſenſum &amp; conatum.</hi> 2 It excludes ſiniſterity of ends, and takes in ſincerity; for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture brands it for an emptineſſe of fruit, when a man brings forth fruit to himſelf, <hi>Hoſ. 10. 1. Iſrael is an empty Vine, he brings forth fruit to himſelf.</hi> 3 It excludes luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſſe and takes in zeal, not that preternaturall heat, miſcalled zeal; for that is a diſeaſe rather then a grace; zeal ſhould eat us up, but not eat up our wiſdome, nor ſhould pride eat up our zeal. 4 It excludes the meere forme of godlineſſe, and takes in power; for form wants the chief dimenſion of holineſſe, which is depth and ſubſtance; therefore thoſe follow not fully, that run be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the commandement in outward form, but walk not after it in morall piety. 5 It excludes withdrawing and takes in conſtancy, for <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to follow fully, and go on to the end, are much at one; hee that walks fully after the Lord, walks finally after him. But this fulfilling after the Lord, doth not neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire legall perfection, as to exclude all ſin out of the perſon, or his ways, for wee heare of none beſides the two <hi>Adams,</hi> in whom it might be ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, there is no ſin; though it was ſaid of one, and may be of other true <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>there is no guile,</hi> or predominant hypocriſie; Neither doth this fulfilling after the Lord, exclude inequality, and take in the ſame meaſure as neceſſary in all, for the fulneſs of two veſſels, doth not infer the equality of them; God hath different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tallented men with grace, parts, means, opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and he doth not require him that hath but one tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, to put forth five.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the more particular explication of the point,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56580:12"/> and firſt, who fulfils after the Lord in duties of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that is when a man walks,</p>
                  <p n="1">1, Univerſally in compliance of heart and endevour to the whole rule, clipping off induſtriouſly no part of that ſervice which beares Gods ſuperſcription upon it, though it may be to him harſh and unpleaſant, yet the command of God ſhall both awe and draw the heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, for that word, <hi>I am the Lord thy God,</hi> makes every Thou ſhalt of his, and every Thou ſhalt not, acceptable to a godly man, and this is to walk <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, fully.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Freely, though no rod be holden over us, the Laws curſe is the Impreſt ſhilling to force a ſervile ſpirit, but the love of God is the byas of a voluntiere. Grace is that whereby God is free in giving to us, and grace is that which makes our hearts free in obedience to him, and this freeneſſe of ſpirit will be moſt ſeen, when there are moſt rubs in the way; for then he that moves by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward poyſes will ſtick and be dull: as when a bowle runs up hill every rub ſlugs it, but when it goes downe hill a rub quickens it; a free ſpirit is enkindled by that which quencheth another man.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Satisfied in part with duty, and with the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſincerity and exerciſe of his graces therein, though ſucceſſe anſwer not; what a joyfull man was <hi>David</hi> when he and his people had offered ſo willingly the materials of a Temple, though he might not build it, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. What pleaſure took <hi>Paul</hi> in infirmities and reproches for Chriſt, when the ſtrength of Chriſt was <hi>perfected in his weakneſſe, 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 10. And this is that ſatisfaction wherein a good conſcience findes ſome reſt, when a man can pray, can believe, wait and ſpeak for God, though the ſucceſs and event anſwer not his duties or deſires, a good heart is loaden with the very burden
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56580:13"/> of duty, and finds eaſe when it is ſincerely diſcharged, let the iſſue be as it will,</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Independent upon, and unreſpective unto the eye and account of men, and that, 1 Though equals inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſed as well as he do deſert him, as the ten did <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua.</hi> 2 Though the people miſconſtrue him, as theſe did them; he that walks by mens countenance or eye, ſteers by a Planet, and not the Pole-Star.</p>
                  <p>2 To fulfill after the Lord when impediments lye in our way, and croſſe winds carry us from the Port, is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 To reckon upon God with us, againſt all moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of oppoſition, ſo <hi>Caleb, The Lord is with us, feare them not.</hi> Thus the Prophet animated his man being in feare, and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his Subjects, <hi>There be more with us</hi>

                  <p n="2">2 To ſtand firm, by ſetting one foot upon the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences wee have had of God, and the other upon his promiſes yet in expectation; for our experience of him, we may argue from his opening of the red Sea, to his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of <hi>Jordan.</hi> Hee that opened the Sea to bring us into this wilderneſſe, will ſurely open a River to let us
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56580:13"/> out. And for his promiſes to his people, they will eat their way over all Alpes of oppoſition, God will be the Midwife of them to deliver them of their wombe, as it's ſaid, <hi>He hath fulfilled with his hands, that which hee ſpake</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 To fulfill after the Lord, being in incumbrances inward, outward, is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 When a man prefers not a quiet <hi>Egypt,</hi> before a troubleſome and hazardous adventure upon the Land promiſed; He will never repent of his choyce of God, nor of his ingagements to his cauſe, though hee ſuffer for it, and loſe by it, he will never ſay, would God I had dyed in <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor ſound for a parley with the world and ſin, nor ſound a retreat to his heart, to march away from the cauſe or work of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 When we miſconſter not Gods intention &amp; mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards us, nor put a falſe gloſſe upon his hand that goeth forth againſt us, like theſe rotten-hearted <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> that cryed God would betray them; it is hard when his covenant, truth and love, cannot vindicate him from all poſſibility of falſhood towards us, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe of us. Keep up good thoughts of God, that if he bring us not into <hi>Canaan</hi> at the fore-doore, yet after he hath led us about to humble our pride, he will bring us in at the poſtern, as he did this people; and if he ſave not <hi>Jonah</hi> by the Mariners, hee may ſave him by the Whale that ſwallows him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The third thing is, why his people ſhould fulfill after the Lord; in which I will be briefe, for <hi>Eliah</hi> his reaſon is enough, <hi>If the Lord be God, follow him,</hi> for all<note place="margin">1 Kings 18 21.</note> attractives are in him, all remuneratives, all reſtoratives, and he expects it of his people, commends it in them, and rewards it to them: He expects it, I know <hi>Abraham</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:56580:14"/> ſaith God, that he will do ſo and ſo: Hee commends it, as here he doth <hi>Caleb, he followed me fully:</hi> He rewards it, as here he promiſeth, and afterward performed to <hi>Caleb,</hi> and generally they that follow the Lord home.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 They ſhall receive more from him; he meaſures li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally back to them that mete liberally unto him: They that will have their fill of God, muſt hold on to the loſſe of a duty or ſuffering, for uſually hee reſerves the beſt and fulleſt cup to the laſt; wee know what <hi>Saul</hi> loſt by not holding out one moment longer, his men melted from him, the enemy was ſtrong and neer, and himſelfe had ſtayed almoſt to the end, yet for want of a minute, he loſt by it, 1 <hi>Sam. 13. 13.

                  <p n="1">1 Of ſafety, as a reed in the ſtream, which ſtands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it yields to the tyde and ebbe, and bends the ſame way as the ſtream runs; the wiſdome of theſe men (as they call it) makes them ſtand as ſpectators upon the ſhore, while the Ship is toſſed at Sea, applauding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alone to have hit the right blot, and cenſuring all others that endanger themſelves for the Truth; If there be deliverance they ſhall have part in the benefit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their care, coſt or trouble, and have ſhare in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings though they have nothing at ſtake: but put caſe a man is not agreed <hi>in hac hypotheſi,</hi> that ſuch or ſuch a cauſe is Gods, and therefore cannot lay out himſelfe in it, or ſuffer for it. I anſwer, when men are indiſpoſed towards a duty they can eaſily plead in Bar, every leſſer ſcruple, or haeſitancy of mind, which if they might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the action, notwithſtanding more preponderating arguments, Melancholy and Satan would have us at ſuch

We ſhould not call any man our father on earth, Matt.</hi> 23. 9. and ſome alſo think it enough to ſay, <hi>This doctrine makes moſt againſt ſuperſtition and popery,</hi> and yet we will not abide that in a <hi>Maldonat,</hi> who ſhal rather pitch upon ſuch a ſenſe of Scripture, becauſe it makes moſt againſt the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and there are who falling upon ſome novell opinion do honeſtate it with the name of a <hi>new light,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves the greateſt illuminates, as having two eyes and all the world beſides but one, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it not, but that every man in his Regeneration hath a new light, which is a part of the new creature; for the new creation begins in a <hi>fiat lux;</hi> Nor do I deny but that in the Church there may be a clearer and further demonſtration of, and inſight into many things in the Scriptures, which have lien in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the pit, and may be brought neerer day then aforetime, for the neerer to the end the more glory and light, as its ſaid <hi>Dan. 12. 4. Shut up the words, and ſeal the book, even to the time of the end: many ſhall run to and fro, and knowledge ſhall be increaſed.</hi> But this light though new to us, yet it is not new to the word,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56580:33"/> to the Sun light is not new, though it be to the Moon, as the Apoſtle cals <hi>ſtrange doctrines, Heb.</hi> 13. 9. not ſuch as are new to us, but ſuch as are forrein to the word: ſo we call that ſtrange light, rather then new, which the word of God ownes not, as the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring thereof, and therefore I exhort you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether this light come from the Word, or rather do not ſhine from a glo-worm in your own fancies? Is not this viſion of yours <hi>extra mittendo,</hi> by beames going out of your own eyes to the object? do you not firſt conceive, and then go forth to ſeek a father for your child? as the Sadduces that firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the Reſurrection, and then think that they can make their hereſie good, out of a caſe in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 24.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether it do nouriſh thoſe graces in you in which the Kingdom of God conſiſts? Or whether doth not this new light ſtarve you? Doth not this ſun-ſhine put out your fire? For whether it be that the intention of the mind upon the vain theory of opinions doth divert the ſtream, and leaves (as I may ſay) practick godlineſſe dry; or whether God withdraw his influences from them that lay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out in toyes? or whatſoever the cauſe be, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſheweth that after this <hi>vertigo</hi> takes men in the head, many of them decay in the vitals of Religion, and turn either Polititians to erect a party, or grow very lean in practicke godlineſſe, and draw looſe in their geeres, if indeed they become not looſe in their lives and wayes.</p>
                  <p>2. This point may give us juſt occaſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56580:34"/> into the reaſon why we are ſo toſſed to and fro and carried about, and crumbled into diviſions, for who is a ſtranger in Iſrael that he ſhould not know theſe things. The heavens are filled with fixed ſtars without number, but the Planets are no more then ſeven; if the proportion was caſt up amongſt us, our <gap reason="foreign">

Is not our Church called to the barre to anſwer not ſo much for her purity or chaſtitie in all Adminiſtrations as for her very being and life? What children are theſe, that will unmother her, before God her husband have divorced and unwifed her? That will throw Babylon in her face, and then juſtifie their ſeceſſion and departure by <hi>Flee out of Babylon:</hi> which will not ſerve their turn except they can find alſo a <hi>Go out of Epheſus, out of Pergamus, out of Sardis, out of Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Our Sacraments are alſo called to the barre. The Lords Supper, under the reaſon of a <hi>mixt Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> by which (as I conceive) is not meant that unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers or unregenerate perſons do partake <hi>rem ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramenti</hi> the kernell of this ordinance; for in that reſpect they have no Communion with the faith full: but that the Company of Communicants in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſeal is mixt of regenerate and unregenerate, Saints and hypocrites; unto which we ſay, that though the door ought to be more narrow than to let in <hi>dogs and ſwine,</hi> yet the preſence and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of intruders doth not evacuate that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the faithfull have with Chriſt, and among themſelves: for the Maſter of the great Feaſt (as

                  <p>Our Baptiſme is ſaid to be a vanity, a nullity, as being diſpenſed to infants, and that becauſe we want example for it: but ſo we do, for womens recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Lords-Supper: and if the reaſon and equity of the rule will carry it for woman as well as men, then alſo we ſhall joyn iſſue in that point, and make it good upon that ground, for children of beleeving parents as for the parents themſelves: for are not ſuch infants <hi>foederati,</hi> confederates and in the Covenant,<note place="margin">See a learned Treatiſe called <hi>The Birth pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.</hi>

                  <p>The morall Law is queſtioned, whether it be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to and directory of a beleever in Chriſt; for becauſe he hath another bridle of reſtraint of him from ſin, and another ſpurre incentive of him unto obedience, therefore he hath not the ſame rule: which is but a confounding of the principle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and of the rule according to which a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is acted; theſe men are much miſtaken in that place whereupon they ſeem to ground their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Rom. 7. 6. <hi>That we ſhould ſerve in newneſs of ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56580:35"/> modos,</hi> two manners of ſerving, in the one of which they were bond-men, in the other free-men.</p>
                  <p>Our Miniſtery is arraigned alſo, as the Papiſts, becauſe the Miniſters of many Reformed Churches have not Impoſition of the hands of a Biſhop, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny their ordination to be legitimate, ſo is ours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, becauſe we had; We are between two mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, what Miniſters will they find in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt for many hundred yeares if this be good againſt ordination? I cannot conceive but God owned ſome of them, for his witneſſes prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying in ſackcloth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 3.</p>
                  <p>And finally to the nullity of theſe; the Church, the Sacraments, the Morall Law, the Miniſtery, is added, the <hi>Mortality of the ſoul,</hi> which if reaſon cannot confute, let a man conſult conſcience, if that cannot, Scripture will; had it not been a ſtrange mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in our bleſſed Saviour to have (but in a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) ſuppoſed a rich man after his death in torment and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome; if the ſoul bee not immortall, or at leaſt if it ſurvive not; for that cannot be applied to the reſurrection, when the rich man will have no brethren on earth to ſend unto, neither can there be any ſence in that portion of Scripture, but upon ſuppoſal of the ſoul outliving the body.</p>
                  <p>I had rather draw a curtain before this face of things then paint it out unto you. How ſad a hearing is it to hear I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> I am of <hi>Apollo,</hi> I am of <hi>Cephas?</hi> was not this that which (as <hi>Jerome</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) did at firſt ſet up Biſhops? our diviſions are their factours, but that is not all; more ſad it is to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56580:35"/> hear, <hi>here is Chriſt, and there is Chriſt,</hi> for we are ſo impotent in our opinions, that every man makes his own to be the very Shibboleth of the Church; a thing unheard of before our times, that men of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Trades in this Famous City, can be all of one Company, but being of divers opinions they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be of one Church, nor wil be all of one School, except they be all of one form, which breakes our communion into fragments; Now what may be the cauſe of this tranſportation of people? are they chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ungrounded in knowledge? That is too much to be feared, or are they proud and wanton, and have taken ſurfet of the great things of the Law? Or are they aſhamed to ſtand in the levell of ſober pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall Chriſtians, but muſt be maſters and ſet up the trade of ſome new opinion for themſelves, and build <hi>Babel</hi> to get a name, and to be ſome body in the eyes of a party? I know not what to ſay, but the Lord ſtop the gangrene, and turn all our eyes to the great things of the Law, that ſo this tithing of mint and cummin may be left to a ſecond place.</p>
                  <p>3. Be not children, and oh that this word might ſtop the fury of your precipitate levity, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> did the ſedition of his Army by one word, <hi>Quirites;</hi> you have had the vitals of Religion, a holy and pure doctrine, and there is not another Goſpell.

                     <hi>God could have drawn up ſuch a charge against his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to whom he was a Saviour, as might have juſtified him to all the world, if hee had refuſed them.</hi> I gather this from the firſt words he ſaid; <hi>He ſaid ſurely,</hi> or (as it elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where is tranſlated) <hi>notwithſtanding:</hi> when one begins a ſpeech with a <hi>notwithſtanding,</hi> hee leaves it to your conception to imagine all that was in his minde which never broke forth; and it carries it cleere enough, that God broke through all the conſiderations of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, apoſtaſie, unworthineſſe, when he ſaid, <hi>Surely they are my people:</hi> and the like forme of ſpeech carries the ſame implication, <hi>Matth. 21. 37. Laſt of all, he ſent unto them his ſon, ſaying, They will reverence my ſon,</hi> as if he had ſaid, They have hitherto killed my ſervants one after another, but they will reverence my ſon: Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the connexion of the former Verſe with my text, <hi>I will mention the loving kindneſſes of the Lord, the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Lord: for he ſaid,</hi> yet <hi>they are my people,</hi> that is, when hee might have ſaid ſo much againſt them as to have deſerted them, and given them up to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: then hee ſaid, <hi>yet they are my people.</hi> It's good for us to obſerve what God might lay in charge againſt us, even then when he crowns us with his favour, or wee
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56580:50"/> proclaim his praiſes: for nothing gives a better foyle to mercy, nothing ſets ſuch an edge upon thankſgivings, nothing ſets the ſtrings in ſweeter tune for praiſes, than for us to conſider and compare our remoteneſſe from expectation of any Salvation, <hi>Make a man first humble, and you make him thankfull,</hi> He that firſt can juſtifie God will the more eaſily and freely glorifie him. We finde not in the Phariſee his <hi>God I thank thee,</hi> any ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning or God-juſtifying expreſſions: Our Saviour obſerves that that Leper who (of ten healed) came one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly back to give glory to God, was a Samaritan. <hi>This ſtranger,</hi> ſayth hee, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 16, 28. Let us ſet our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall ſins before our eyes this day; when we come with our peace-offerings for publike mercies, theſe ſowre herbs will quicken our palate to the reliſh of this Paſſeover, for it is a Paſſeover indeed, God having made the deſtroying Angell to paſſe over the houſes of his people, and led the ſtroke to finde out them that would keep us ſtill in <hi>Egypt,</hi> after God cals us out; And to let paſſe all thoſe provocations of God by this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſo many yeers of reſt. Let us looke upon the face of our wildernes-ſins (as I may call them) and what were Iſraels wildernes-ſins? murmuring againſt God, complayning of his dealing with them, diſlike of his Covenant, contempt of his Promiſes, returning in heart into <hi>Egypt.</hi> And are not our carcaſſes as worthy to fall in the Wilderneſſe as theirs did? For it was not for their <hi>Egypt</hi>-ſins, but for the wilderneſſe-ſins, when they werein paſſage to the promiſed Land, that God ſware in his wrath againſt them, that they ſhould not enter<note place="margin">Heb, 3. 10, 11.</note> into his reſt. Have wee not cauſe to tremble leſt God ſhould enter the <hi>caveat</hi> of ſuch an oath againſt us for the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56580:51"/> ſins wee are guilty of in this our paſſage. What bitter complaints of, and murmurings at, Gods dealing with us? What mutinies againſt our Leaders? what evill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports are brought up of the Reformation intended? what luſting after the former fleſh-pots? what calling for Captains to lead us back again into bondage? what dancing before the golden calves of new opinions and ways of our own erection? and yet God is our Saviour with a <hi>non obſtante</hi> to every of theſe miſcarriages: <hi>Let us rejoyce with trembling,</hi> and be broken into thankgivings. In our receiving of ſuch high grace and favour, we muſt look to two things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The relliſh of the mercy beſtowed, which is quickned by ſenſe of our unworthineſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The diſgeſtion of it into thankſgivings, prayſes, and obedience.</p>
                  <p>In reliſhing of a mercy a man eyther looks upon it as a <hi>benefit,</hi> and ſo hee gives thanks to God as the <hi>benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour;</hi> or as it is a fruit of prayer, and as it is the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of God in which he is ſeen in wiſdom, power, preſence, goodneſſe, and ſo he praiſes God as the <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi> for that is the difference between thankſgiving and praiſe, the one looks at the benefit, the other at the workmanſhip of God in it. If one give you a Watch or curious piece, the benefactor hath the thanks, the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath the prayſe. There are more thankſgivers, than prayſers of God, becauſe though many taſte the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, yet few taſte or ſee God in it.</p>
                  <p>And for the digeſtion of a mercy beſtowed, it is much according to the relliſh of it. He that reliſlies onely his own intereſt or good in it, turns it oftentimes into mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſelf-glory, ſecurity, &amp;c. but he that ſees God in it, <hi>The joy of the Lord is his ſtrength,</hi> to make return of prayſe and ſervice to God again.</p>

The way that <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh took, was to ſingle out the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceres</hi> by gifs &amp; indulgences, that he might (as <hi>Commines</hi> ſaith) the eaſilier doe what hee would with the leſſer ſhrubs, <hi>the commons,</hi> and by that means he ſued out his livery; and as himſelf expreſt it, he delivered the <hi>French</hi> Kings from their Wardſhip: you have read what God offer'd <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 32. 10. <hi>Let me alone that I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them, and ile make of thee a great Nation,</hi> which condition <hi>Moſes</hi> accepted not; he would not be hired for a private intereſt to deſert his place and duty.</p>

                  <p>If the way of God ſhould upon diſcovery prove hard and incompliant with ſomepolitike conſiderations, intereſts, ends, would you then hew and pare the wood to the rule, or the rule to the wood, or make abatement on both ſides?

Who knoweth if God will return, and repent, and leave a bleſſing behind him? As David in this Text was at his If, and If. If I ſhall find favour, &amp;c. But if he ſay I delight not in thee, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Text holds forth unto you the equal temperament, and the even poize or poſture of a gracious ſpirit in a doubtful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: He whoſe heart is ſteered by ſuch a Compaſs, will ride even in all ſtrait Seas whatſoever. I ſhall but briefly touch the hiſtorical part, becauſe it hath not much influence into the Text.</p>
                  <p>Abſalom had ſtolen the hearts of Iſrael into an Inſurrection againſt his Father, the Conſpiracy was both ſudden and ſtrong. David being in fear of ſurpriſal, reſolves to flee from Jeruſalem. There was a hand of God in this, for he had told David before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, that for the matter of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah he would raiſe up evil againſt him out of his own houſe, 2 Sam 12. 11. Now it is come to paſs, The Prieſts and Levites would go with David, bearing the Ark of God: But whatſoever ſuperſtitious conceit the people had in bringing the Ark of God from Shiloh into the Camp againſt the Philiſtines; David had none, for he had learned by that example, that even the Ark might fall into Philiſtines hands, 1 Sam. 4. 3. Therefore he ſaid to Zadok, carry back the Ark of God into the City; If I ſhall find favour in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again, and I ſhall ſee it and his habitation <gap reason="foreign">

Where you find no diſcompoſure or aeſtuations of ſpirit in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, no exclaiming againſt the impiety of his Son, or againſt the unkindneſs and ingratitude of Iſrael, no curſing of his ſtars, no bitter invectives againſt male-inſtruments, for theſe things are but the ſludge that is uſually caſt forth by the overflow of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>But being of an equilibrious frame of ſpirit, lays himſelf down at the feet of God, whether he pleaſe to lift him up, or

No that's madneſs, as we muſt ſow to the ſpirit, ſo we muſt ſerve providence. God will not be tempted into miracles, David at this time had ſent forth his eſpialls and intelligencers, he had a counter-mining Huſhai in the counſels of the enemy: To have means in our hand, and not to uſe them, is ſecure unbelief, to uſe them and truſt in them, is proud unbelief, and this is our epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demick ſin, when we ride upon the arm of fleſh then we gallop, when we are unhorſt and ſmitten off that, then we lie deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and cannot keep our legs, either we ſwell or ſink, in our victory and ſucceſſes hitherto God hath firſt ſhown us the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of our ſtrength, and then made bare his own arm. Its even

In our ſucceſſes we are proud rather then, thankful, in our ſtrokes we are rather broken then hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, oh that we would caſt away theſe bladders that help to drown us. The ſtile of man is Alexander or Caeſar hath gotten ſuch a victory; But the ſtile of Scripture is, The Lord dicomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Siſera before Barak Iudges 4. 15. 23. It was ſaid the ſword of the Lord and of Gideon. How poor an army was it with which the ſword of the Lord was coupled, yet the victory was ſo examplary and ſignal, that it is made a pattern of an utter overthrow, Iſay 9. 4. as in the day of Midian and again, do to them as to the Midianites Pſa. 83. 9. and therefore as it is in Tragoedies when the ſcene is come to ſuch a paroxiſm, or ſuch a knot as there ſeems to be no way out: then Deus a machina, comes in and heales all. So when things are doubtful deſperate, inextricable, let God have your eyes, who can reſolve every riddle and lead you out of the Labyriuth.</p>

Free grace is the refuge or the plea of the moſt righteous man. Noah was a juſt man, and perfect in his generations, and walked with God, and he found favour (ſaith the Text, Gen. 6. 8.) in the eyes of the Lord, but ſome may ſay, why doth David appeal to favour? was he not innocent as to Abſolom, who roſe up againſt him; and as to them that roſe up with Abſolom? was there not ſin in the adverſe party? and godlineſs on his part? there is no queſtion of it; but yet David had former ſins which were now remembred to him, and he flies to meer grace and favour, and inſiſts on that plea. It was favour and meer grace that put Noah into an Ark, when all the world beſides was drowned; And what is it but Grace and Favour, that hath ſhut you up into an Ark of ſafety: Now when ſo many Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and Countries are brought under ſpoil and miſery, and (which is not the leaſt part of mercy) hath freed you from temptations of betraying either your lives or your conſciences, and from being put to ſuch diſguiſements of your ſelves, as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>was, when he changed his behaviour before the Philiſtines, 1 Sam. 21. 13, When God comes down in judgement againſt a people, there is ordinarily a reaſon to be found in themſelves. The Marriners knew that the ſtorm fell upon them for ſome cauſe, and therefore they went to the lot. And David when the famine did hang upon the Land from year to year, inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Lord for what it was, 2 Sam. 21. 1, And for our own caſe, there is certainly a reaſon in our ſelves why the Sword is ſo long in our bowels, which we ſhould ſearch out upon theſe days of inquiry; for the ſmarting corroſive would drop off, if it did not find raw matter in the ſore, which makes it ſtick faſt, and eat into the quick. But now for the matter of our recovery, if ever God bring us again to ſhew us his Ark, and his Habitation, it muſt, it will be meer grace and favour, which grace is as powerful as it is free: Powerful, I ſay, to break through all obſtructions, lay flat all Mountains of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, remove all impediments; and therefore it is ſaid; If I find favour, he will bring me again; let Abſolom, let Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56580:63"/> let them all do what what they can: As ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Divines do aſſert grace to work irreſiſtibly in a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, ſo may I aſſert it as irreſiſtible in reducing and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back his Churches and people, from under the yoke of any enemy; God that works graciouſly, works omnipotently and we know as little Why as How. This is that which doth moſt indear God to an unworthy ſinner, and which doth moſt kindly melt the heart towards God again. Nothing doth ſo at once raviſh the heart into admiration, and lay it low in ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confuſion.</p>
                  <p>The Inferences which I draw from this Point by way of Uſe to our ſelves, are theſe;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Doth David now at this time when he might eaſily in his affliction ſee his former ſins, the greateſt that are recorded of him in the Scripture Faſten his eye upon the free grace of favour of God, as to which his reſtoring was poſſible? then why may not we, who are now under wrath for thoſe many heynous national ſins of ours, fly to this free grace of God. and therein likewiſe apprehend a poſſibility of our reſtoring, we are not ſhut out by our ſins from free grace; that which takes away our iniquities, is not taken away by them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all the aggravations of our ſin, do not prohibit our application to it, nor bind the hands thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that David builds not upon the ground of either the enemy his wickedneſs, or his own godlineſs and integrity, but derives his bringing back again from meer favour: it may reach us to caſt away all falſe flattering arguments, which are the foundations of our proud hopes; one while we look on the prophaneneſs and wickedneſs of our enemies, and gather thence a kind of ſelf-preſumption, as though God might not uſe ſuch ſcorpions to correct his own people withal; or not ſell the Iſraelites into the hand of Moab, Ammon, Philiſtines, people worſe than themſelves; otherwhiles we applaud our own godlineſs and ſincerity, and do bottom our expectations rather upon ſomewhat in our ſelves, than the free grace and favour of God to us.</p>

Put the caſe then both ways, and ſearch your hearts, whether your compaſs will not vary at ſuch a time, but ſtill point to the true pole, and whether you can and wil abide in the Ship, when it ſeems neer to breaking all to pieces.</p>
                  <p>And there is reaſon why we ſhould caſt up events both ways, not ſo much in reſpect of the cauſe it ſelf, as in reſpect of our reſolutions and ſtanding to it, for the cauſe of God and of Religion will proſper, and will ſwim ont of all waters; of that we have no doubt, though the viſion be yet for an appointed time.

                  <p n="2">2 The unpreparedneſs that is in us to cloſe with God, his way and truth, many think it religion enough to cry King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, with them the power of godlineſs lies under as great ſcorn and diſreliſh as ever, and though we have ingaged our ſelves by Covenant, yet is that Covenant made by many but as it were a faſt and looſe knot, or a meer Shibboleth of diſtinction between party and party, how many are willing to compound for ſuch a Reformation as may ſerve ſelf-intereſts, or politique reſpects, making their own ends the ſtandard of Reformation, not the word or glory of God?

                  <p>The Symptoms that are upon us, are very ill abodements, as namely, the diviſions and ſidings in matter of Religion, which is firſt turned into a kind of Philoſophy of opinions, and then divided into parties and ſects, as the old Philoſophers were; After the great and general deluge of corruption of Doctrine, and ſuperſtition in worſhip, we are fallen into the confuſion of Languages. And then again, what emulations in Officers that have great command? as if they had an Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander or a Caeſar, or a Pompey in their breſts, making too much ado about punctilios of honour? what diſſentions in the country between Committees and Commanders, the one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing the other for plowing away a furrow of his land, and the other recriminating the like, and whiles they come up hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conteſt the difference, the Plow ſtands? what ſhould I ſpeak of driving of deſigns, and of the carriage of many in this cauſe, meerly by intereſts, and not by principles, which kind of men can never be firm, for intereſts will make any man looſe and uncertain; He hath the byas in his Pocket, which he can put off and put on, as the mark lies, nothing makes men firm but principles, for ſuch a mans byas is within the bowl, eſpecially if his principles carry him to God, as well as you, for otherwiſe he will not be always yours. Now if all theſe things be laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they make good reaſon why we ſhould caſt up both events.</p>
                  <p>The ways and diſpenſations of God towards us are ſo dark, as by them we are not able to diſcern cleerly of his particular mind or thoughts, as touching the iſſue or event, when we are (as we think) at ſhore and ready to land, there comes a guſt, and waves us back into the deep again, The Ark is carrying to Jeruſalem, and there falls out a breach upon <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah and ſtops the work. The war hangs long upon us, and who knows where or when the Tragoedy ſhall end. How long have the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56580:66"/> German Churches, (where the firſt day-break of reformation began) been under a thick cloud, and many a time when they have ſeemed to ſee land, they have been driven back again with croſs winds. Thus do the ways of God, like Arethuſe, run under ground. He hides his paths and his ends, and he is in the thick darkneſs; ſo that we ſee his goings: but are as much to ſeek for the meaning of his diſpenſations, as the boy was that ran to fetch Jonathans Arrows, whereby he made diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to David.</p>
                  <p>This we know, that God hath not pinned his Ordinances to the freehold of a Land Nation, City: therefore he ſaith, Jer. 7, 12 goe and ſee what I did to Shiloh where I ſet my name at the firſt, and what was that which he did to it? Pſal. 78. 60, 61. He forſook the Tabernacles of Shiloh, the Tent that he had pitched among them, and delivered his ſtrength into captivity, and his glory into the enemies hand, whence it may be affirmed that though God do not altogether remove his name from the Iſralites, yet he may change the place thereof, from Shiloh to Jeruſalem; and ſo though he do plant his Ordinances ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in his Church; yet the Candleſtick may be removed, and the Kindome of Heaven taken away from this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular place or Nation.</p>

Though the waters of Noah return no more to cover the earth, yet ſuch a Houſe, City, Country may be overflowed and ſwallowed up with water; ſo may our Ark fall into Philiſtims hands; and therefore gather your ſelves together, ſearch your ſelves Oh Nation, even Ye our worthy Senators, call your ſelves to account, and examine your ſelves ſtrictly, impartially, humbly, leſt the Babyloniſh garment and wedge of Gold (which cauſes Iſrael to fly before the men of Ai) be not in any of your Tents, ſearch out car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal policy, luke warmneſs towards God; Neutrality, private ends. Its not impoſſible but that there may be an Abſolom, a Shemei in your own bowels, who if you were brought low, would drive you and the Ark of God too into the Wilderneſs, to ſeek a place. Oh let the repreſentative body of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome keep themſelves pure, that ſo if God ſhould pleaſe to eſtimate, or meaſure out unto the Nation, according to the repreſentative body of it, there may be mercy to it for your ſakes. To this end, have an eye [I beſeech you] upon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructours and deſigners, which cannot do ſo much hurt in the enemies Army, as in your Counſels; Malignity thruſt forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the outward parts of the body, is nothing ſo dangerous, as that which lies cloſe and neer to the heart or vitals: Speed the hearing of Cauſes which come before you, that men may be diſmiſt to their commands and employments abroad to prevent a vacuum. Pity and relieve thoſe that are broken and ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrackt for the Kingdomes ſake: have an eye upon your under-Inſtruments and Officers, that they ſpend you not more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reputation by their miſcarriages, partialities, private gain: than they bring you in ſupplies; he that flies a ſharp Hawk, rides hard after her, or elſe the Partridge will be half eaten before he come in; And fear not the loſing of any party by doing Gods wil and work; for God himſelf ſhould neither give rain nor fair weather; if he ſhould pleaſe all ſorts of men, I ſhall leſs ſtick on theſe things, becauſe you were this day before put in mind of them; only let me preſs one thing more, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; That you would countenance honeſt and godly men, with places of command and truſt; With command, for they will be firm and valiant, a mans valour lies in his conſcience, and not in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56580:67"/> his ſpirit: With truſt, for ſuch a man is like a door with two locks: He hath an obligation upon him, both to God and you. Finally, do all that may be to ſuppreſs open and crying ſins, for authority makes it ſelf guilty of thoſe, other mens ſins, which it endeavours not to cut down, we in the Miniſtry muſt cry them down and you muſt cut them down, or elſe they become in guilt both ours and yours.</p>
                  <p>And let none of us ſay within our ſelves, we have ſtrength for war, for Eccleſ. 11. 9. The battel is not to the ſtrong, We have received many marks and tokens of favour from God, for Ioſh. 24. 19. He will conſume you after he hath done you good. We are the Iſrael of God, to whom pertain the Promiſes, for Joſh. 7. 8. Iſrael flies before the Aians, We have the Ark of God in the Camp with us, for 1 Sam. 4, 10, 11. The Philiſtims may take it, We faſt before the Lord and have a good, cauſe for Iudg. 20. 21. Iſrael falls in two battels under Benjamin. We are not ſo bad as the enemy that comes againſt us; For its no truſting to the ſins of an enemy. The worſt bryars or thorns may ſerve for a rod in the land of God, to ſcourge his own people: We are Gods witneſſes, for Rev. 11. 7.

If you be in a good cauſe, that is not all, for hypocriſie and baſe ends will more pull you down, than the goodneſs of the cauſe will lift you up.</p>

I would the Reformation did not lie under an ill report with many amongſt us. God would not bring the Iſralites into Canaan whilſt it was under an ill report with them by reaſon of the ſpies who undervalued it. It may coſt us a longer march in this wilderneſs, if we look upon it with a ſcornful eye, and yet the prejudices againſt it, and the aſperſions caſt upon them whom you have ſet on work to be hewers in the Mountains to prepare the materials of the Temple, are many; and I fear the reaſon is, becauſe nothing that is one can pleaſe, except it be a quodlibit; a grand ſallet, it will not fit ſuch variety of pallates as are amongſt us, I pray God ſuch a birth may be brought forth, as that there may remain no diviſions or ſeparation from us in conſcience, but only in pride and affected ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; there is the leſſe regard to be had of ſuch as are reſolved aforehand, not to be fixed in the ſame or be with us, but like the erratick ſtars muſt each one have an oabe to himſelf. If any mans conſcience lie (as I may ſo ſay) in his fancy, then to give

                  <p>David expreſſes his ſufferings, yea his utmoſt ſufferings, by the phraſe, Good in Gods eyes, If he ſay thus, I delight not in thee, Here I am, let him do that is good in his eyes: He might feel it evil, but if it be good in Gods eyes, he yields to it; and ſo let our hearts be humbled and framed in expectation of Gods hand to us at this time, that we may kiſs the rod, and ſay with old Eli, when he heard the fall of his houſe: It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good 1 Sam. 3. 18. We know not what Promiſes or Propheſies God hath given forth to his Church in his Word to be ſerved and fulfilled by or upon our ruins. If God pleaſe not to honour himſelf by our labours, let him honour himſelf by our aſhes.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall not intricate my Diſcourſe with any Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical diſputes about Happineſs, wherein the Philoſophers were ſo much divided in opinion, and into parties, an evident demonſtration of the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men by nature, ſhooting ſo wide from the mark in ſo concerning a point, but ſhall for the better opening of the happineſs of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the <hi>wilderneſs eſtate of Iſrael; and their Canaan eſtate,</hi> and ſo of their happineſs in their

How can his ſweet voice be reconciled to his rough hand? We muſt anſwer, That the Birth of the Promiſes, will anſwer their Conception, they will bring forth in full ſhape and feature, the glory with which they are pregnant; but that muſt not be expected, until they come to their full count: for there is a fulneſs of time, wherein the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhall be delivered; until which the great and good things we hope for, do lie in their wombe, and we muſt be content, if we ſay, as the Mother of Jeſus, <hi>They have no wine:</hi> to hear, Woman, what have I to do with thee, <hi>My hour is not yet come.</hi>

It is a happines to be under promiſes, though the thing promiſed be poſthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to us. He is not poor, that hath good debts lying in ſo rich a hand as Gods: and we may find it true in our experience, that all the while God keeps in his hand the principal, he pays his people the full intereſt for forbearance, and maintaines them in their minority with ſome competencies out of the revenews which he hath entailed upon them when they come to full age. <hi>Jacobs</hi> proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under <hi>Laban,</hi> while he was an exile, and a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, was far from that bleſſing to which he was heire, but yet it was a remarkable hand of that God who was in bonds to him for a great ſum.</p>

Doublemindednes is a diviſion of heart between God and ſome other preponderating luſt, or ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſt; and ſo where there ſhould be no diviſion, but ſingleneſſe and integrity, there is diviſion; For all the heart, all the minde, all the ſoul, and all the ſtrength, is that which God calls for. There are ſome that have <hi>no heart,</hi> they have no thoughts of God, no relliſh of him, no byaſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; it was an ill omen in ſacrifices, <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do cor defeciſſet,</hi> when there wanted a heart; there
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56580:98"/> can be no expectation of any returne of heartles Prayer, heartles performance of duties; and this is the common poſture of ſpirit of the ignorant, and ſecure worldlings. There are ſome that have dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hearts, they pretend to have a zeale of God, and they profeſſe the Name of Chriſt, and hang out the Chriſtian colours: but through hypocriſie and partiality to their own ends, and ſelf-reſpects they halt between God and <hi>Baal,</hi> or endevour to comply with two maſters, or they part friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and love between God and the World, as <hi>Verſe</hi> 4. Ye adulerers and adultreſſes, know ye not that the friendſhip of the World is enmity with God? There are ſome that have one heart, and this is that which God promiſeth to his Covenant people, and wherein he delights, when the heart is <hi>totum homogeneum,</hi> whole and undivided from him, then is it a perfect heart, and of a happy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or conſtitution, being of chaſt love, affection and faithfulnes to God, not vitiated or deflowred by carnal copulation with other baſe luſts or ends; do but obſerve our Saviour in that ſaying of his, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 22, 23. how he oppoſeth unto a <hi>ſingle eye,</hi> an <hi>evill one;</hi> If, ſaith he, <hi>Thine eye be ſingle,</hi> and then when you would have expected that <hi>double</hi> ſhould have bin oppoſed to <hi>ſingle,</hi> he ſaith, But if thy eye be <hi>evill,</hi> thereby ſignifying, that if it be not fingle, it is naught and evill; and wheras one might think, that a double eie hath more light then a ſingle: our Saviour tels us the plain contrary, that a ſingle eye makes the body full of light, but a double eye
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56580:99"/> fils it full of darknes; Its true, there is in a double minded man, ſome eye to God, that is, ſo as to uſe his name to ſerve ſelf-ends, or to colour and cover his ſiniſter ayms and intentions. As a harlot whoſe heart goes after unchaſt loves, will yet have a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band too, (that is) to colour and hide her lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; ſuch are theſe which are double-hearted: they have a Sabbath for God, and ſix days for their luſts: they retain to God, and wear his cloth, and ſomtimes wait and attend, but they are their own men for the moſt part, and work for themſelves; Religion unto them is but the ſtalking horſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſides whereof they creep, to get a ſhoot at their own game; how often doth God in Scripture finde fault with this kinde of Profeſſours? <hi>When ye faſted,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Zech. 7. 5. did ye at all faſt unto me, even unto me?</hi> and againe, when they howled upon their beds, they have not cryed unto me with their heart, they aſſemble themſelves for Corn and Wine, and they rebell againſt me, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 14.

                  </p>
                  <p>In the opening of this point, I ſhall follow the threed of that explication of this word (<hi>double minded</hi>) which I gave in the beginning.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 This double mindednes is an uncertainty of the heart with God, not fixed upon a Centre, but off and on, as times, occaſions, and intereſts doe lead on, or draw off, ſo farre you will goe with God, as your way and his doe fall out to hold:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56580:99"/> together: and untill you muſt pull downe <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boams Calves,</hi> as well as <hi>Ahabs Baal;</hi> and then you part with him when it comes to ſuch a pinch; ſo alſo in adverſity or affliction, wee make <hi>nautarum vota,</hi> Mariners vowes (as they doe in a ſtorme) and when wee are on ſhore, and landed out of danger, wee eat the Covenant wee made before, <hi>Pſal. 78. 24. &amp;c. When he ſlue them, then they ſought him, and they returned and enquired early after God, and they remembred that God was their rock, and the high God their Redeemer. Nevertheleſs, they did but flatter and lye unto him, for their heart was not right with him, nor were they ſtedfaſt in his Covenant.</hi> If the heart was right with God, it would be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and ſtedfaſt with him. Conſtancie is but the daughter of Synceritie. Its a hatefull thing to ſet ſail to every winde, and to change colour ſo often, being no faſter tyed to God in the tempeſt, then we can be looſened in the calme; <hi>Be what you were in the ſtorme:</hi> in your affliction you will abide to be ſpurred without kicking, and are very tame under reproofs: but when you are lifted up and are at ſhort, then to put you in minde of your Vowes and Covenants in the day of your trouble, is as an unpleaſing a thing, as to put a Mariner at ſhore in minde of his Vowes or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made at Sea. Its no great danger to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove men ſharply when they are low, any cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard may ſtrike a man that is down, but (believe it) when men are aloft and high, and may more ſafelyer he dealt withall by ſtroaking, then by
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56580:100"/> the ſpurre, then it is ſomwhat to come nigh the heels of truth, for it may haply ſtrike out his teeth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This double mindedneſſe is a diviſion of the heart from God. 1.

Between God and the world, or God and our own ends, as they here in the Text: when we make God a meere ſervant to our ſelves, and move upon a private centre of our own: the heart is cunning &amp; ſubtile in ſquinting towards its own ends: viſibly we will be for God: under hand we ſeeke ourſelves: ſo the planets in their daily motion from Eaſt to Weſt, move as the fixed ſtars, but they have another motion of their own, which is creepingly by ſtealth, and more unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable then the other.</p>

                  <p>The greateſt matter above-board, and which all mens expectations and mouthes are full of, is the ſetling of Religion and of the Church.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56580:107"/> of publike and univerſall lamentation.</p>
                     <p>That I may ſet up ſome lights about the Herſe of <hi>Abner,</hi> you may pleaſe to call to minde:</p>
                     <list>

                        <item>2. His Project.</item>

                        <item>4. His Funerall.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p n="1">1. His Office was Captaine of the Hoſt, or <hi>ſtylo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo,</hi> Lord Generall of the Forces of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> it was not ſo much becauſe he toucht King <hi>Saul</hi> in bloud, being Couſin-Germane, as in reſpect of this high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that he is called, <hi>A Prince, and a great man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. His Project which he had upon the Anvile now at his death, was the reducement of all <hi>Iſrael</hi> unto the Scepter of <hi>David;</hi> herein his Project concurr'd with Gods; but took riſe in him, from an ill or ſuſpicious ground. <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> doth but queſtion him for familiar uſage of a Concubine of <hi>Sauls</hi> (which if true, was in thoſe times accounted a kinde of <hi>Crimen Majeſtatis</hi>) and this heats his bloud, <hi>for great Inſtruments will not be are a checke</hi>) and thereupon his Stomack brings him off to <hi>David. God uſeth the ſins and great Spirits, or animoſities, of great men (though they be not carried by Conſcience) to bring to birth his owne purpoſes and promiſes made to his</hi> Davids.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. His Fall; which was by the hand of pretended revenge, but reall emulation; the ſpirit of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> was in <hi>Joab,</hi> before it was in them: He could not abide a corrivall or equall. Let great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders looke to this; Ambition is a Planet that muſt have a whole Orbe to it ſelfe, and is impatient of Conſort.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. His Funerall; and that was ſolemne and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56580:108"/> in <hi>Hebron;</hi> now the royall City, and former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Sepulchrall of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, &amp;c.</hi> At which, <hi>David</hi> was <hi>chiefe mourner,</hi> for he followed the Bed or Herſe, <hi>verſe</hi> 31. and he was <hi>the Oratour</hi> that made the ſpeech of Lamentation; as he had before done for <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan, 2 Sam.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
                     <p>Now for the Herſebefore you, let us ſee how farre it paralells with this in the Text.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Prince or great man fallen this day in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was Captaine Lord <hi>Generall</hi> of the Hoſt of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> There is agreement in the Office and Title; the Text could not be proper to any fallen under our Meridian unto this day: but unto this new ſtarre created by the Parliament, and ariſing in this Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, about <hi>July</hi> 1642. and now eclipſed or fallen.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. His project is written in a copy fairer then the originall, and goes farre beyond that of <hi>Abner.</hi> The reducement of divided <hi>Iſrael</hi> into one hive is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what alike in both. But here is no effeminate ſpark that raiſeth the ſpirit of this great man into a flame; no ſuch cauſe of his engagement, but the defence of thoſe pupill twinnes, the two bleeding ſiſters ready to dye in each the others boſome, the <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi> of the Subjects of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. His fall is cleere of the diſaſter in <hi>Abners</hi> ſtory; he falls not by the hand of ſome unworthy and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous deſertor of him, made bold by his vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or flight, as <hi>Pompey</hi> did; nor by the juſt fury of an oppreſſed Senate as <hi>Caeſar</hi> did; nor by the arts and ſtratagems of a treacherous death as <hi>Abner</hi> did; <hi>The hand of</hi> Joab <hi>is not in all this;</hi> but by an <hi>Euthanaſy</hi> (which <hi>Auguſtus</hi> wiſht for) a faire death. Hee dyed in peace.</p>

                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:56580:108"/>4. His Funerall for the ſtate of it certainly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matches the patterne. Here are the two Houſes of Parliament, the map of all England in two globes, powring out their ſorrowes, and paying their kiſſes of Honourable farewell to his tutelar ſword.</p>
                     <p>The Princes of the Land that quarter with him in in honour and in bloud, doe quarter with his herſe this day in blacke and mourning.</p>
                     <p>The flowre of the renowned City of <hi>London</hi> (far ſurpaſſing the meanneſs of <hi>Abners Hebron</hi>) doe traile their teares after his Herſe, and are come to put upon him their <hi>civicam coronam,</hi> their civicall crown of Honour, <hi>propter ſervatos cives</hi> for their ſaved Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.</p>
                     <p>The reverend Judges and the Worthies of that gowne, doe preſent the mourning teares of the lawes that pay this tribute for their freedome from all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian prerogative.</p>
                     <p>The honourable ſouldiery, thoſe great names which while they wore his Orenge in the field, could have daunted death it ſelfe, doe now in change of colour weepe over him (and what marble weepes not in ſuch change of weather?) <hi>David</hi> that could take a lion by the beard, yet weepes at the Herſe of <hi>Abner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The gowne alſo hath its ranke with the ſword in this great Army of mourners. The Aſſembly of Divines whoſe prayers hee ſomtimes valued and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted, neede not be diſtreined for their contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of teares &amp; grief, they muſt wrap up in a cloth, and lay up behind the Ephod this <hi>Goliah'</hi>-conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſword in memory of a very cordiall and noble Patron.</p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:56580:109"/>
                     <p>Laſtly, what ſhould I ſay of thoſe ſtarres that come not into any conſtellation. I meane perſons of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty not within the rankes, yet within the line of this Lamentation, together with that infinite multitude of all ſorts, from Cedars to the hyſop, that doe not onely come to fill their eyes, but to empty them?

                     <p>Concerning that which is ſpoken of the dead, therein you ſhall finde the reaſon or ſpring of the teares of this lamentation. <hi>A Prince and a great man fallen, and fallen, this day in Iſrael.</hi> This day in-<hi>Iſrael</hi> hath the Emphaſis in it.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Great man</hi> is a note of ſome ſingular eminencie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the ordinary trees of the wood, and is a title gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25. 2.</note> even to a <hi>Nabal</hi> that hath 3000. ſheep and 1000. goats, which is the meaneſt ranke of greatneſſe.</p>
                     <p>But where a <hi>great man</hi> is added to a <hi>Prince,</hi> it may well import as much as <hi>magnificent,</hi> a man of power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful intereſt, great valour, honourable atchievements, noble activity in his place. <hi>Magnus</hi> is an addition or hatchment by which <hi>Alexander, Pompey, Carolus,</hi> &amp;c. have beene ſirnamed, for their great ſervices or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits. So that a man by his orb or place he is ſet in, is <hi>Princeps:</hi> but by his influence and beams of worth, raying from him upon the ſublunary Commons, he is <hi>Magnus.</hi> It is an excellent conjunction, a <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>great man.</hi> According to ſtyle of honour with us, a man may be noble by birth, diſcent, or blood. And though I be none of the new <hi>Switzers,</hi> that could wiſh Princes Canton'd into the common level; yet I may put you in mind that <hi>Antiquity of Race</hi> is but a Moſs of time growing upon the back of worth or vertue: And if a man carry not the primigeniall vertue with him, which firſt made his race noble, he is but a flower by change of ſoile degenerated into a weed, as having nothing in him but the wax or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without the form and ſtamp of Nobleneſſe.

I cannot teach you to be princes, <hi>Fortuitum eſt;</hi> but I can tell you how to be great men: not great in the glaſſe which Paraſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call flattery holds before you, but indeed; and that is thus: Fill the ſphere of your activity, the Church and State, the Towne or Countrey, with the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and benigne influences that flow from intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call worth: make the times the better for you: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine by your example your inferiours to know God, and reform their Families. Let not Profaneſſe hide it ſelfe under the wing of your patronage, nor leſſen it ſelf by the greatneſſe of your examples. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial &amp; ſpeedy Juſtice, with ſweet refreſhing Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, will make you great men in the Commonwealth; Zeal and Syncerity for God and his Houſe, will make you great men in the Church. He that will be a great man, muſt draw his lines to the center of publike good: private ends never make a great man.</p>
                     <p>2. The ſubject of this Lamentation is, <hi>one Prince, one great man.</hi> Yee are called (as ſome interpret the word,) <hi>the Corners of the people; the Shields, the Gods, the Saviours, the Shepheards of the people, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God for Good, Benefactors, &amp;c.</hi> Now the fall of one great Tree makes a great gappe in the hedge;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56580:111"/> the Eclipſe of one of the greater ruling Luminaries benights the world. Our Lives, Liberties, &amp;c. are all bound up in you: we poor men ſteal into our Graves, with no greater noyſe than can be made by a branch of Roſemary, or a blacke Riband: No body takes notice of the Gloeworme, that goes out in the hedge bottome: No Comet or Prodigie, or Earth-quake tolls us the knell of our departure; but one of you is carried forth by the teares all ISRAEL, provided that you be what your Names import, publick men, common Sanctuaries of the oppreſſed, Cities of Refuge, Altars of protection; for otherwiſe you may be ſuch as that your death would be more worth then your lives, and then, though you may be able to put men into black, you cannot put them into mourning: Your death cannot be worth a teare, when your lives are not worth a prayer.</p>
                     <p>3. The ſubject of this Lamentation is, a Prince &amp; <hi>A great man fallen.</hi> Death is a fall from every thing but grace: ſome do fall from a higher Scaffold; great men fall divers ſtories, from Honour, Riches, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; others from the ſurface of a level ground, having nothing to fall from but naked life. Saints dye, the gods doe fall: I need not ſtand to prove it, there is not one of you great men, but ſhall be the proofe of this point ſhortly. The Law of Death runs thus: All Honours, Titles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the contrary, in any wiſe notwithſtanding: &amp; there is no Prerogative to check this Law.

                     <p>The former is troden by great men: the Prince in my Text was ſent home this way; and ſo was the firſt man in the world that dyed. The Sword hangs in a hair over the heads of great ones, who are often cut off by the hand of emulation and animoſity. That<note place="margin">

                     <p>4. The ſubject of this Lamentation is a Prince and a great man fallen in the time of his agency and uſefulneſſe for the ſettlement of the deſtractions of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> It was a time that the promiſe of God to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was at the birth, and the Midwifery of <hi>Abner</hi> was offered. Let <hi>Abner</hi> otherwiſe be what he will for a man. <hi>God may uſe an Egyptian midwife to bring forth the childe of an Iſraelite.</hi> But this great man
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56580:112"/> falls in the very nicke of time, before the good iſſue of his deſignes. Let me point out this Obſervation to you:</p>
                     <p>Its not unuſuall, that <hi>great builders catch a fall when they are upon the ſcaffold aboute their worke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Oh how it amazeth the faith of Gods people, when the ſtar that led them out of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, goes out of ſight before it have brought them to their journeys end. That youngling world of Reformation in <hi>Luthers</hi> time, had a ſore temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, when it muſt ſee the fall (as I may ſay) of the Electour of <hi>Saxony</hi> and others that were pillars of hope. <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt live no longer then to bring <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the plains of <hi>Moab:</hi> himſelfe is allowed but a proſpect of that he hoped to have enjoyed, and to have brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> into We are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preſidents: our eyes have ſeen ſome of our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lights eclipſed, <hi>pleno orbe,</hi> when they have been at their Full. The great God that hides his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, knows his Works from the begining to the end, and he takes off ſuch Inſtruments that he may ſhew that he doth not <hi>need,</hi> is not <hi>tied</hi> to any tool: for he made the great world without any. When he ſaith <hi>Faciamus,</hi> he ſpeaks to himſelfe alone; not to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and man. Thus he makes way for ſome other Providence to come upon the Stage, and brings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Worke by a more crooked Inſtrument, which wee imagined ſhould be done by a ſtrait one. So <hi>Iſrael</hi> is ſpeedily reduced to <hi>David,</hi> though <hi>Abner</hi> fall. Or he humbles his people juſt before his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes take effect; and firſt ſtrikes them dumb before he open their mouthes in a <hi>Benedicite;</hi> that the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of his handmaidens may break forth into a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56580:113"/> 
                        <hi>Magnificat:</hi> or the time is not yet come that <hi>Iſrael</hi> is to be brought out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> and therefore though <hi>Moſes</hi> begin to reſcue the <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> and ſlay the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> yet he muſt flee for it, and be hidden for Fourty years. Or elſe he pulls the ſtool of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence from under us, becauſe we ſit down upon it: or elſe pulls up the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>luce of ſome judgements which have been hindr'd by ſome <hi>Lot</hi> or great man, or whatſoever it be. We ſee that God writes the Names of our beſt and greateſt men in the ſhell, and takes them away by a kind of Oſtraciſme. All the help, hope, and comfort is, that God hath all inſtruments eminently in himſelfe, and can raiſe up a <hi>Ioſhua</hi> in ſteed of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Wherefore if his Diſciples cannot caſt out the evill Spirit, let us come to himſelfe, and make our ſelves as ſure of his Word by faith, as he is ſure of his word by promiſe; for though <hi>Ioſeph</hi> die in Egypt, yet he layes his bones at ſtake, that God will ſurely viſit his Iſrael, <hi>Gen. vlt. ver.</hi> 25.</p>
                     <p>5. All this that hath been ſaid, a Prince, a great man fallen at ſuch a time, <hi>is juſt reaſon of ſad and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne lamentation;</hi> and therefore <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> is in this mourning poſture: ſuch a man whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence had a large circumference or ſphaere while he lived, is followed by an honour and ſorrow of the ſame compaſſe when he dyes: You <hi>Princes and great men,</hi> death will tell what the world thought of you; while you live (it may be) Sycophants &amp; flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers lay their egges in your eares, and hatch mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous opinions in you of your greatneſſe. Such Books uſually build in the higheſt Trees and on the other ſide, envy &amp; detraction may breath upon the glaſſe of your reputation, that it ſhall not (while you
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56580:113"/> live) report ſo cleare an Image of you, but death wil make thorow-lights in you; that you ſhall be ſeen on both ſides; ſorrows will not, cannot be tongue-tyed; you will then begin to reape your due. Then the world breaks out into theſe expreſſions; Hee was a brave man, He was a great Courtier, that could not be curbed with a white ſtaffe, to bee of counſell to ſubvert the freedomes of his Countrey; He was a Captain that could draw a line, but not to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble center of his private ends; He was a Juſtice that would ſcatter the drunkards from their Ale-bench, and did not underſtand the language of a bottle or a basket; He was a <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> whoſe kindneſſes were great which he ſhewed to the houſe of God, and the Offices thereof; He was a Miniſter that could not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thunder in his Doctrine, but lighten in his Life; He was a <hi>Papinian</hi> (a great Lawyer) but hee would not defend Imperiall and arbitrary exorbitances, though he dyed for it; He was a man that appeared &amp; ſtood for the truth, and for God in the worſt times, when the <hi>Summer birds</hi> were hidden in their hollow Trees; He was a man firm and fixed, and ſtudied not the neutral art of putting off the cap to one, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a leg to another. And is not this a brave Eccho, are not ſuch men worthy of the Honourable tears of Iſrael? or elſe Iſrael hath reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to mourn for the ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe and ſtupidity of their own hearts. And for the State and honour of mourning, it is an ancient ſolemnity credited by time, and great examples, yea, and almoſt the common ſenſe of mankind. For both Egyptians and Iſraelites concurre in weeping for <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> whoſe Exequies were performed in great Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page when he was cared out of Egypt; and not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

                     </p>

Honour will follow after worth and merit even into its grave. We doe not lay up the carkaſſe of every Cole-ſhip with that reſpect as that of <hi>Drakes</hi> was; though confeſſedly the one muſt rot, as well as the other.</p>

                        </gap>, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that you muſt fall. Greatneſſe hath need of ſome correctives. You are ſuch Pictures, that if one ſtand of the one ſide of you, <hi>You are Gods;</hi> but if he looke upon you on the other ſide, <hi>You are men,</hi> and muſt dye <hi>like men:</hi> this takes you one ſtep lower; nay, we may goe lower yet; For man being in honour without underſtanding, is <hi>like the beaſts</hi> that periſh. We are all proud; pride is the ſhirt of the ſoule, which it puts off laſt when it ſhifts: And every riſing ground of authority or power, makes us riſe in thoughts. The very bramble, if it get a ſnatch of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, will be talking of his ſhadow. Oh that you had the meeknes of that <hi>Moſes,</hi> whoſe face did ſhine, but he knew not that (I ſpeake this by alluſion) the skin of his face did ſhine. I would that but every tenth thought of your riſing, was accompanied with one thought of your falling: And yet you have more reaſon to have death in your eyes then other men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Venice Glaſſes, and China mettall of your fine and tender bodies, will not abide ſo great a ſtroak as other earthen pots of courſer mettall; I will not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56580:115"/> offer to you thoſe complements with death, whereof we read good ſtore, in uſe among great men; as the boy that cry'd, <hi>Memento te mortalem;</hi> or that, of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting ſeverall ſorts of Marble to the Emperor upon his Coronation day, that he might then chuſe which he would have for his Tombe, &amp;c. But let me preſſe the ſenſe of your falling condition to humble you. I doe not meane by humilitie a morall familiarity or courteſie toward thoſe of lower ranke, which yet is a gracefull condeſcency of Greatneſſe: But I meane, a ſtooping to the reproofes of the Word of God, brought unto you by the Miniſters thereof, who are but earthen veſſels like your ſelves: Submit your cheek to reproofs, for your owne ſins, and of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. Let not your iniquities take ſanctuary in your greatneſſe; Frowne not your Chaplaines into a meal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth'd baſeneſſe, ſo that they dare no more make a darke or oblique reflection upon your darling ſins, then take a Beare by the tooth. If you will bleed out your ill bloud, you muſt pull off your Velvet ſleeve, and let the arme be bare to the point of the knife: Keep no State againſt God, though he ſpeake thunder and lightning by the mouth of duſt like your ſelves. A man never makes worſe uſe of his greatneſſe, then by it to caſt a muzzle over the mouth of ſound and ſearching reproofes. And it is a juſt judgment of God upon ſuch men, that they ſhould have Prophets, that will ſay to <hi>Ahab, Goe up and proſper.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Quicken you to activity in your places while you live, that you may ſerve your generation according to the will of God before you dye, and ſee corruption; otherwiſe, you are but blind lights in gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Candleſticks: You are in great debt, both to the Church and Common-wealth, they have truſted you
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56580:115"/> with all they have, and your bond is good; but yet be not offended, if they call hard upon you to pay your debts, for you are mortall men, and we know not what Heires or Executors you may leave behind you. The Creditor is oftentimes broken in the Debtors death; Get death into your minds, and it will put life into your actions; what you found made of poore Bricke, leave in ſtately Marble, and be not like many, who while they are riſing, appeare very active and ſtirring men; but when they are up doe freeze into a benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſlowneſſe, like Bels that ſtrike thicke when they are riſing, and afterwards when they are at full pitch, are ſet; put your ſelves on with this ſpurre, I muſt ſhortly dye: How ſhould I live fruitfully? The night will come, how ſhould I labour while it is day? I wiſh well to things that are good: but (<hi>Bene cogitare eſt bene ſomniare</hi>) a good thinker is but a good dreamer; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ſads and duls the heart when one comes to dye, than his neglect of ſuch opportunities which Gods providence, or his owne place have put into his hand of receiving &amp; doing good. Nor is there a ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per corroſive, than the reflection upon thoſe dayes and times that have paſſed over him, <hi>Male, aliud, nihil, agentem.</hi> The higheſt hils are the barrenneſt ground, and I would that ſaying did not ſo truly ſquare to great Ones (that is) that the goodlieſt Trees, as Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars, &amp;c. doe either beare none, or the worſt Fruit. Great parts and abilities without exerciſe and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth are but ſecret and unknowne Mines of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Gold, which lye hid in an unfruitfull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſoyle. And therfore, you the great and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Worthies, in whoſe hands are the Publike Faith, the Publike Mercy, the Publike Juſtice, and the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Peace; be good, and (let your goodnes make you)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56580:116"/> quicke diſpenſers of what you have in Stewardſhip, becauſe the time is ſhort, and the word <hi>redde rationem</hi> may be given ſuddenly, look upon us as mortall men, who ſhall not live long to receive, and upon your ſelves, who ſhall not live long to give the fruits of your hands. And becauſe the Occaſion invites me, let me propound an object to your charitable juſtice, that is, the relief of thoſe great ſufferers who have bin great doers, I meane the firſt adventurers with this great Commander, when he firſt cut through the Alps. As for the great and doubtfull matters that are under your hand, I would not be thought ſo raſh, as to wiſh you to precipitate: A Pilot among ſhelves and rocks may be too quick; A <hi>Cunctator</hi> ſometime ſaved the Common-wealth; only thus I may pray, that when the Haven lyes faire before you, and is without barre, you may <hi>fortiter occupare,</hi> ſet in ſtifly, leſt new waves, raiſed by croſſe winds, carry you backe into the Main againe.</p>
                     <p>3. Arme you againſt your fall, that the day therof may be to you (as the Paſſion-day of the Martyrs was called) the birth-day of Eternity. <hi>Nequaquam morte mortemini,</hi> was the inlet of our ſin and miſery, &amp; keeps the doore open to ſin ſtill; The Epicure hath his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour againſt death: a ſenſeleſſe conſideration of it, as of a nothing, or a not being. The great Spirit hath his Armour too; A contempt of death out of principles of Valour and Honour; but neither of theſe Armours can keep the arrow from the quicke; There is a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble clauſe in the Statute of dying, <hi>And after that the judgement.</hi> Nor yet will I goe about to arme you with this meditation, that we ſhall have a ſhorter journey from death to life again, than we had from not being, unto life, or that which is cited by <hi>Gerard</hi> out of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:56580:116"/> that all the time that hath run, or ſhall run out from the beginning, to the end, ſhall ſeeme to <hi>Adam</hi> when he riſeth againe, but <hi>tanquam ſomnus unius horae,</hi> as the ſleep of the body for one houre; But if you will breake the fall, which elſe will breake you, then you <hi>Gods</hi> muſt become <hi>Saints</hi> (for all Gods are not Saints) the death of Saints is more precious then the death of Gods; Grace is ſpeciall baile againſt death, there is no gall and vinegar in it to be drunk by them, for whom Chriſt hath already drunke it: <hi>Death</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>is yours,</hi> becauſe contributory and ſubſervient to your happines; That life which is hid with Chriſt in God, is out of the reach of death, our Saviour proves <hi>Abraham</hi> to be living, becauſe God had long after his death, ſaid, I am the God of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Thoſe that are confederate with God in Covenant, muſt always live, that the Covenant may not be diſſolved by the death of the one party. There is a way then to break the teeth of death, and to be immortall: Have God for your God; labour to have ſomething in you that is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall beſides your very ſouls; lay up for your ſelves a treaſure beyond the ſea of death, that when this <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brana dignitatis</hi> (as <hi>Seneca</hi> cals it) a thin skin of honour breaks, you may not be quite bankrupts; enrich your ſouls with the power of godlines, which is profitable to all things. The place of Princes, the magnificence and great works of great men; The faith and godlines of poore men doe make a rare compoſition. Do not in ſtead of diſarming death, arme it rather againſt you, by putting a ſword into the hand of it. The more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that you may doe by the advantage of ground you ſtand upon, the heavyer will your accounts be, if your greatnes be made a Stage and Theater for to act the parts of luxury, laſciviouſnes, oppreſſion upon. What
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56580:117"/> difference is there between ſuch gods, and thoſe in <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> of whoſe drunkenneſſe and adulteries there is frequent mention; let me ſpeake one word to you, young Noblemen, and Gentlemen, Learne you the way of godlineſſe, that may free you from the looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and vanitie incident to greatneſſe; for when you have given <hi>florem Diabolo,</hi> the floure of your time to luſts of youth; your fall may come before you can ſo much as give <hi>faecem Deo,</hi> the dregs thereof to God.</p>
                     <p>I conclude this point with that which one obſerves upon Gods ſeeing all the works that he had made, that they were <hi>very good,</hi> for then immediately (ſaith he) followed the Sabbath, or reſt of God, which (though our ſalvation be not of workes) may ſignifie thus much to you, that when you ſhall come to a retroſpect upon your wayes and works, and find them ſo empty of, and contrary unto God, there can be no expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sabbath or reſt unto your ſoules; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>waſh ye, make ye cleane, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 1. 16, 17.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond, <hi>Know ye not,</hi> is ſpoken to you, the lower ſhrubs. You are to know that your great men may fall in the very time of their uſefulneſſe and ſervice for your good. In their loſſe, bewaile your ſins: for though you feele not the ſtroke while the wound is freſh and green, yet afterwards you will find the want of ſuch as are worthy inſtruments, when wee expect they ſhould doe great things; God by taking them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, interrupts the caſt. Put not therefore your truſt in Princes, nor in the ſon of man, in whom there is no ſalvation; for his breath goeth forth, and in that very day his thoughts periſh, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 146. 3, 4. even his projects and intentions for your good, dye in the wombe, and are abortive. If we leane hard upon the reed, it breaks the ſooner, and wee are laid flat on the ground.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56580:117"/> God will not let his people enjoy that long, which they prize too much, ſome worme ſhall ſmite that gourd, and it ſhall wither; and though many great men are not likely to be blaſted by the confidence of the people, yet our ſad experience teacheth us, that we ſmell too much to our ſweeteſt flowers, and ſo wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them.</p>
                     <p>I Shall now come to the paralell Herſe of that <hi>Prince and great man</hi> fallen this day in <hi>England,</hi> of whom, though modeſtie it ſelfe may without bluſhing ſpeak in a magnificent ſtile, yet have my thoughts waved me too and fro, it not being eaſie to be moderatour of the Arguments that are for ſpeech; or ſilence. Not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the matter will ſurpaſſe the work-manſhip, and the copiouſneſſe of the ſubject ſhame, the penury of my expreſſion; but becauſe on the one hand it is argued, that Funerall Encomiaſtickes of the dead, are very often confections of poyſon to the living; for many, whoſe lives ſpeake nothing for them, will draw the example into conſequence, and be thereby led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hope, that they may preſſe a hackny Funerall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to carry them to Heaven when they dye; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if ſuch for whom no file could be rough enough while they lived, be ſmooth-filed when they are dead: on the other hand it may be ſaid, That though comon graves have no inſcription, yet Marble Tombes are nor without ſome Epitaph. Heroicall examples ſhould not go with a common paſſe, but with a Trom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet. <hi>David</hi> afforded this Honorary to <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Abner,</hi> and (which is to be obſerved) he drew not any line in their pictures with a black coale, which yet he might have done, for both of them had too much ſhadow if he would have uſed it; but he dealt with them as the Painter did with <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who had but one eye, he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56580:118"/> drew his Picture, <hi>imagine luſca</hi> halfe-faced, and ſo bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the deformitie out of the beholders ſight.</p>
                     <p>Neither is this all, which makes me ſtand in a ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery place, but the various ſenſes and cenſures too, which are very likely to be found in this great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: Some that hated the ſound of his Drums and Trumpets, will not patiently endure the <hi>Eccho</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounding to their diſ-affected eares. And ſome againe are indifferently content to heare ſome good words of his Epitaph, becauſe it begins with <hi>Hîc jacet,</hi> here he lyes; as <hi>Caracalla</hi> ſaid to them that deſired, that ſome honours might be ſpent upon his Brother <hi>Geta,</hi> now dead out of his way: <hi>Sit divus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>modo non ſit vivus,</hi> honour him as you will, ſo as he doth not live. The moſt voyces will doubtleſſe vote, that it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to ſet up a Candle to the Sunne, for his ſtory is yet alive in all mens memories, and the ſtage where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he acted it, is yet warme. The truth is, I had rather leave him to the hiſtory, which I hope the honourable Houſes have beſpoken, and to that <hi>Homer</hi> that ſhall be the <hi>praco</hi> of this <hi>Achilles.</hi> But becauſe his name would ſometime have paſſed me clear through all Guards, and probably hath not as yet loſt that vertue; and that this State and preſence ſpeakes him with more eloquence, then I, ſo that I can but run the hazard of being an imperfect interpreter by word, of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which your ſelves doe ſpeak by ſignes. And ſince death hath put him beyond pride, all beyond en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and my ſelfe beyond flattery, what if wee make a ſhort Index of his Story, and audit his <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Character of his <hi>Excellency,</hi> may be that which <hi>David</hi> ſometime gave to <hi>Abner,</hi> the great man in my Text; <hi>Art not thou a valiant man, and who is like thee in all Iſrael?</hi> When the time was come that <hi>Ianus</hi> Temple muſt be open'd here in England, by the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that onely hath the key of it, Neceſſitie, and thoſe orphane ſiſters (before ſpoken of) Libertie and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie were to chuſe their Guardian, Champion and <hi>Vindex;</hi> you the Honourable Truſtees, looked out for a <hi>Dictator,</hi> in whoſe hands you might depoſite, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry being, ſafety, freedom, lives, <hi>Senatus populique Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> of the Parliament and people of England, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily pitcht your eye and choyce upon this man, who was <hi>ſtirpe &amp; ingenio bellicoſus,</hi> One that had honour to give credit to the Cauſe he undertooke, reputation to vindicate his undertaking from contempt of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Intereſt, whoſe Drum could preſſe an Army; dexteritie to manage the Sword, Counſell to direct it, Valour to uſe it, &amp; faithfulneſſe to diſcharge it. And he was the man you then reſolv'd to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>dye</hi> with. It was the greateſt honour in the world, to be credited with the infinite <hi>depoſitum</hi> of the life and being of the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi> And at this time, when you had aſſigned this Theater to act his part upon, it was the higheſt honour to him, that he would undertake to Pilot a Ship ſo laden with ſo great a fraught, through the tempeſtuous and angry Seas which then began to ſwell and be intractable, when this poore Kingdome, knew not for the moſt part, how to weare Buffe and Steele, untill taught by him; in whom that ancient Chivalry and Valour of <hi>England</hi> (which had left it's Monuments in <hi>France</hi> and other parts of the world, but of later times almoſt emaſculate and grown obſolet) was concenter'd, and by tranſmigration had layd
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56580:119"/> it ſelfe up in him: He was the man that was to breake the yce, and ſet his firſt footing in the Red Sea; a <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> but not <hi>in bivio;</hi> a man reſolved, when others hung in ſuſpence; fixt, when ſome ſtarres of greateſt magnitude were moved with trepidation, or erratick. That filled the breach, when many lay <hi>poſt principa,</hi> &amp; behind the hedge. No Proclamation of Treaſon could cry him down, nor threatning Standard daunt him: That in that miſty morning, when men knew not each the other, whether friend or foe, by his ariſing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel'd the fogge, and by his very name, commanded thouſands into your ſervice. Such as were for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and groaned under preſſures in Religion, he tooke by the hand, and they him: Such as were Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, and would ſtand up for common Liberties, he tooke by the hand, and they him, and ſo became the bond or knot of both, as the Axletree of the world upon which both the Poles doe move: And this muſt be his honour alone for ever; for though <hi>Ioſhua</hi> alſo doe admirably when he comes to it, yet it is <hi>Moſes</hi> that firſt leads forth Iſrael by their Armies.</p>
                     <p>Thus he enter'd, and for his deportment upon the Stage, and the experience he gave of himſelfe, who knowes not it? Such was his <hi>perſonall valour,</hi> as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſteele had gone to his compoſition.

                     <p>I muſt leave to the large Map of his Story, thoſe many memorables &amp; victories, which bear his name; for even great places doe not always find any room in a little Map, and ſhall inſtance him but in one other particular, that famous expedition to <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> when we were at a very low water, and this Eagle had then alſo moulted his feathers, and having imped themwith renowned Londoners, did fight the greateſt part of that long march thither, where the then Governour whom I may (borrowing <hi>Cicero</hi> his word) call <hi>hujus Regni Stator,</hi> the Stator of the Kingdome of England, (becauſe he tooke the enemy his horſe by the bridle in his full career, and ſtopt him, and being reſolved to ſell that City to them by the candle) was reſcued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the candle dropt, by this noble Champion, who retreating from that Tropick, fought his way backe againe through hunger and hardſhip and becauſe this Retreat ſhould not be like an empty field without ſome charge, He ſcattered that great Army near <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,</hi> and to you this renowned City, <hi>reddidit Legiones,</hi> reſtored your valiant Legions, and reſtored England to it ſelfe; An unparalell'd Expedition.</p>

                  <p>Their deſtruction is exemplified and paralleld in three terrible examples, the caſting down of the <hi>Angells that fell,</hi> the deſtruction of the <hi>olde world,</hi> the overthrow of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha.</hi> It may make the eares of all haereſie-Maſters and their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to tingle when they heare that the three great and famous monuments of Gods ſore wrath executed by his owne immediate hand are brought in as examples of his vengeance againſt that wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which above all other pretends exemption and liberty from the ſtroke of men.</p>
                  <p>Their manners (in the deſcription of which the greateſt part of this Chapter is taken up) are drawn out in ſo foule colours, that every man may make the obſervation, That <hi>monſtrous doctrines</hi> are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>monſtrious luſts.</hi>

                  <p>Falſe Prophets and falſe teachers are paralleld, both in their <hi>being</hi> in the Church, and in their <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> or deſcription.</p>

                  <p>1.

                  <p>Nor are the Arguments more preſſing, then the occaſion; for the Jewiſh Chriſtians (unto whom diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, after the diſſolution of their own eſtate,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 1.</note> through the <hi>Aſiatique</hi> regions, our Apoſtle is thought to write) were not quit of the reliques of that old fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which generally ſowred that whole Nation; (<hi>viz.</hi> a mutinous and froward diſpoſition to all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy) beſides their own; with which ſcab they might infect other Chriſtians, who had both plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Arguments, and great temptations to conclude it very incongruous, that the ſubjects of the kingdome of Chriſt, called to the beſt and higheſt liberty by the Goſpel, ſhould ſubmit themſelves to the ſword and ſcepter of Infidels, Tyrants, Perſecutors, whoſe laws forbidding the profeſſion of the Goſpel; or commanding abhominable Idolatry, they were obliged by a greater obligation, and upon a higher penalty not to obey; and that was the very reaſon, that the Heathen calumninated them with open mouth, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute peſts of the Common-Wealth, enemies of mankind, ſubverters of all Authority.</p>
                  <p>Our Apoſtle though writing (as it is ſaid) under <hi>Nero,</hi> whoſe univerſal wickednes, and particular cruelty

                  <p>For having given forth general Inſtructions unto all Chriſtians for a Godly converſation. ver. 11, 12. he deſcends to relative duties of ſubjects to Magiſtrates, of ſervants to Maſters, which as then they were moſt queſtionable, ſo they are alwayes moſt burthenſome; and he calls for them as parts of a Godly converſation. <hi>Sins againſt our relations as in all men unnatural, ſo in a Chriſtian they are ſcandalous.</hi> A child, a ſubject, a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, not better for his religion in the duties which their relation doth beſpeak, is ſo far from being an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to his profeſſion (as the meaneſt may be) that they bring ſhame upon it, and are in ſome reſpect<note place="margin">Titus 2. 10.</note> worſe then an Infidel.</p>

                     <head>To the <hi>MAGISTRATE,</hi> and that in three Uſes.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. THat he may lawfully take the ſword which God and Man puts into his hand; It is not lawfull in a Heathen hand, and unlawfull in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. The ſence of all Orthodoxe Chriſtians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending from the Apoſtles to theſe dayes, makes it plain, He is the Miniſter of God, his ſword-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, his ſheild-bearer; Let it not be preached out of your hand by a Jeſuite, in a <hi>Socinian,</hi> or in what cloak ſoever.</p>
                     <p>It's not much to be doubted, that ſuch Emiſſaries have left their neſts to make Proſelites amongſt us, for where the ſore is, there are the flies; nor any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they ſhould call the Pope Chriſts vicar, when they are at home; and Antichriſt when they are here: when the Devil appeared to Chriſt as a Devil, he comes with <hi>if's; If thou be the Son of God?</hi> when he is in the poſſeſſed, Then, Thou art Chriſt the Son of God, when they are at home, the Magiſtrate is little better then the Popes Executioner, or hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, when they are here, they would not have the Magiſtrate ſo much, being ready by their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and the old revenge, to perform that office themſelves, and therefore they are reſtleſs untill they accompliſh that which <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> obſerved, that the Wolves and Foxes would be at agreement with the ſheep, but they muſt firſt deliver up their dogs, the old act is to bring Magiſtracy firſt out of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56580:173"/> reputation, and then where is their authority; let them take what ſhape, and pipe what tune they will, let not <hi>Argus</hi> cloſe his eies.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Remember that Government is not for them that Govern; but them that are Governed: not for private, but publick ends; every thing that moves, though it be a ſtone, moves to the Center of the world, you are eccentrick when either honour or wealth take you up; the ſhepheard may receive the fleece, and eat the milk of his flock, but his office is to keep the ſheep, for this cauſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. ye receive tribute becauſe you do <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p n="3">3. If our ſubjection be <hi>propter Dominum,</hi> then uſe your authority <hi>propter Dominum,</hi> he that keeps ſheep feeds their bodies, he that rules over men that have ſouls, muſt conſider that you may not, cannot compel faith or conſcience, but you have a buſineſſe in matter of Religion, not as <hi>Uzziah,</hi> but as <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> (ſaith Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi>) by encouraging the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and pulling down the neſts of Idolatry, you know the fourth Commandement is directed to the Maſter, to the father, to the Magiſtrate, The ten Tribes after they had caſt off Gods Religion never had a good King, and their Kingdome unſettled and tottering, as a learned Knight obſerves from thoſe words, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14. 15. they were <hi>as a reed ſhaken in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56580:174"/> the water,</hi> that moves this way and that way, and never ſtands quiet, and therefore let it be upon your hearts that you are the Miniſters of God for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to puniſh the evil and to praiſe the good, and we are the Miniſters of God for the reprooving of the evil, and encouragement of the good; <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> both helpful to one another, both Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God in their way; and though the Church and Common-wealth be two bodies, not ſeverally but reſpectively, yet one and the ſame man may be a member of both, and therefore the ſoundneſſe or ſickneſſe of the Church, is of great concernment to the Common-Wealth, both Phyſitian and Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are converſant about one body, the one reſpects the inward diſeaſe, the other the outward ſore, ſo <hi>Haereticus qui errat,</hi> is under our, <hi>haereticus qui turbat</hi> under your office; we may be one without the other but not in a Chriſtian Common-Wealth, and therefore let the one uphold the other, Miniſtry up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Magiſtracy, Magiſtracy uphold Miniſtry, the want of the one will make too much work for the other, and let the Pole that holds up the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, ſtand, I ſpeak as to the office of the Miniſtry, for their maintenance; the ſubject of the time for diſcourſe, I have little to ſay, nor is it needful to ſpeak to you (bleſſed be God) but this obſerve that God hath ſeated our Argument in every other mans breaſt; even in their breaſts that maintain us, as if God would have them to feel their own Arguments, and acknowledge ours in their own.</p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:56580:174"/>
                     <p>The Magiſtrate, for this cauſe receives tribute, becauſe he attends on the Common-Wealth;</p>
                     <p>That's our Argument.</p>
                     <p>The ſouldier hath our Argument in his breaſt, who goes not to warfare at his own charge.</p>
                     <p>The husbandman hath it alſo, who plants a vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; who plowes, and ſowes, and doth not reap the fruit?</p>
                     <p>The ſhepheard hath our Argument at home, who feeds the flock, and eates not the milk?</p>
                     <p>The very labourer hath our Argument, for the labourer is worthy of his hire.</p>
                     <p>The Oxe if he could ſpeak (as once the Aſſe did, and reproved the madneſſe of the man) would uſe our Argument; I thraſh, muzzle me not. And are not we in theſe liſts? Yea, for if we ſowe ſpiritual things, why ſhould not we reap of your carnal things, a fit Argument for a Merchant upon the Exchange, for this is but a ſpiritual exchange, <hi>carnal things</hi> for <hi>Spiritual things;</hi> Haply they will allow us Almes, but Scripture is not content with that word. It muſt be honour, and becauſe that might not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by a jejune reverence, it is called a double honour, let any man in his calling, ſhew a title bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſured.</p>

                        <head>More particularly,</head>
                        <p>Firſt, for you (my Lord) that are the ſetting Sun: It is your happineſſe that you can uſe that ſpeech of <hi>Hezekiah, There hath been peace in your dayes;</hi> I commend to you that excellent cloſe of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel, 1 Samuel</hi> 12. 3. when he laid down his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>Whoſe Oxe have I taken, whoſe Aſſe, or whom have I defrauded, of whoſe hand have I received any bribe?</hi> Go off with thanksgivings to God, and let this Citie and your own conſcience give you thanks, but withall ſet all accounts clear between God and your ſoul, and remember that a year of Majoralty may bring more ſinne upon you, then all the dayes of your life: I mean, ſuch ſinnes as are called our <hi>noſtra lerna,</hi> our-other mens ſinnes which are ſuch as happily a Magiſtrate little thinks of.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, For you the Electors, I ſuppoſe you know your rule, take heed of that which is the bane of all ſocieties, ſedition and tumultuouſneſſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe, I know you may be deceived, in your choice, the Hiſtorian ſaith of <hi>Galba</hi> that he was <hi>om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium judic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>o dignus imperio, niſi imperaſſet,</hi> ſome mens ſins go before, &amp; ſome follow after, and we know not what unſeen leakes may be in a veſſel, untill, there be ſomething put into it, but let your aim be right and hearts be unbiaſs'd; It's a great liberty you have to chuſe whom you muſt be ſubject unto, and a great happineſſe that you have ſo many good men to chooſe out off, we undervalue the greateſt benefits when they are common, and you lift up the hand
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56580:176"/> in courſe many time, rather then in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                        <p>In the generall, your eye ſhould be pitcht upon a good man, and upon a fit man: for every good man is not fit for this ſervice, nor for this time. The Hebrew Maſters recount ſeven properties of a fit man, markt out in two places of holy Scripture, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus 18. Deut.</hi> 1.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, <hi>An able man,</hi> that is as the word imports, a ſtout man, well reſolved againſt bribes and fears perſwaſions and menaces, not like an empty bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance that ſtands tottering, and a penny weight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines it. It is a curſed Principle of Machiavels, among his other Paradoxes in policy; he would have a ſubordinate Magiſtrate, <hi>inſtar molae truſatilis,</hi> like a hand-mill which a ſuperiour Magiſtrate may eaſily turn round, as he will.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Fearing God,</hi> for he that rules for God hath need to fear him with a pious fear: and he that fears God as a private man, will in all likely hood, fear him as a Magiſtrate; in ſerving God being a Magiſtrate, in thoſe things wherein he cannot ſerve him, but as a Magiſtrate: For, <hi>In hoc,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,) ſerviunt Reges Deo, in quo non poſſunt niſi ut Reges.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Men of Truth, or juſt men.</hi> He that rules over men, muſt needs be juſt, 2 <hi>Samuel,</hi> 23. and he that is by giving <hi>ſuum cuique,</hi> the long coat to the Dwarf, if it be his: for default whereof, <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> his Maſter, whipt him when he was a Boy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he conſidered in the childiſh controverſie
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56580:176"/> that came before him, were like a Taylor, for whom the Garment was moſt fit, then like a Judge whoſe the coat was.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>Hating Covetouſneſſe;</hi> that bribes throw not duſt in his eyes. He is the beſt Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that is good for nothing, A rare Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue!</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>A Wiſe Man;</hi> One that (as they ſay) hath his third eye; that is, Experience: For an ignorant Magiſtrate, doth juſtice by adventure, and that oftentimes is by miſadventure. It is a ſaying of <hi>Luther,</hi> That if a wiſe man, and a good man both cannot be had, rather chuſe a man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally good, then intollerably ignorant; As if you were to ſeek a Pilot, a Lawyer, a Phyſician, you would chuſe ſuch a one, as in his facultie is skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, <hi>A known man;</hi> or One of good fame for Reputation makes Authoritie valued, which other wiſe is rendred contemptible.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, <hi>One that is of the Chief of the Tribes,</hi> Deuteronomie 1. 15. <hi>A Cedar, an Olive, a Vine, not a Bramble.</hi> For three things the Earth (ſaith the Scripture) is diſquieted, A ſervant when he reigns, &amp;c. <hi>Nec Bellua tetrior ulla eſt.</hi>

                        <p>You Sir, that ſhall be Lord Major in Fiftie three, as hath been a year <hi>male</hi>-ominated to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Citie; do not you fear the Stars; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry old woman that can dream a tale is not one of

Keep if it be poſſible the State which the City hath allowed you, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> in Egypt did that, which the King had put upon him, for he that deſpiſeth himſelf is the more eaſily deſpiſed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and let Religion have your Countenance, which hath crowned this land with ſo many bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, ſuch miraculous preſervations, as are peculiar to <hi>England;</hi> remember whoſe Miniſter you are, that ſo you may have courage, and for what end, that you may maintain your comfort.</p>

Rom.</hi> 13. 5. you muſt needs be ſubject, ſuch importunity of command and reaſon is uſed, as may ſuggeſt to us, ſome doubt of the indiſpoſedneſs or averſion of Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other men towards Magiſtracy. And indeed the Apoſtle ſignifies of ſome Pſeudo-Chriſtians in the laſt times. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. that they ſhall be lovers of themſelves, tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, heady &amp;c. having a form of godlineſs. Yea, and it ſeems there was ſuch a ſpawn of Chriſtians in being even in thoſe times, for both the Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude,</hi> as if they ſpoke with one mouth, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 10. Jude</hi> 8. do tell us of ſome of them that <hi>deſpiſed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, speak evil of dignities.</hi> And you may conceive that from the examples of ſome, the infamy would redound upon the whole profeſſion; yet that this libertiniſme flows from the luſts of profeſſed Chriſtians, and not from the principles of Chriſtianity, I prove thus.</p>
                  <p>1. Becauſe Chriſtianity doth not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the common law of nature, nor the common notions of truth or goodneſs, that are in a natural conſcience, but rather ripens and improves them, for otherwiſe when one puts on the Chriſtian, he ſhould put off the man. <hi>All truth is ours,</hi> all truth and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56580:182"/> goodneſs, though the pearl be found in the dunghil yet it is ſet in the ring of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I ſpeak to <hi>wiſemen</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, and again doth not <hi>nature teach you;</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſence of authority muſt be as deeply planted in him who is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſociable as well as others and the ſence of brutality as remote from him, who hath not the armour of horns and hoofs for his ſelf-defence more then other men.</p>
                  <p>2. The particular principles of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity do well conſent with the uſe and fruit of magiſtracy, and not in the leaſt fight againſt, or oppoſe the office.</p>
                  <p>The uſe and fruit of it is a quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life in all godlineſs and honeſty, for this is good and acceptable with God. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 3. Quietneſs and godlineſs, Peace and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, what can be more agreeable to our profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>That the principles of it are not of leaſt tincture of averſneſs to the office is plain, by the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which reckons the reſiſtance thereof, the reſiſtance of the ordinance of God, and involves every reſiſter under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2. and by the grand <hi>pattern</hi> of our profeſſion Chriſt Jeſus, who being tempted upon the queſtion ſaid, <hi>Date Caeſari,</hi> and looked through <hi>Pilate</hi> to the gift of his power from above; yea and wrought
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56580:182"/> one of his miracles upon the ear of an officer raſhly wounded by <hi>Peter</hi> in defence of him.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon of this point is, that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Jewiſh religion in their nation might have a government calculated and cut out unto it in ſome reſpects; yet Chriſtianity is ſo compounded and made up of ſpirituals, as may well comply with any form of civil Common-wealth in the world <hi>with every ordinance of man,</hi> whether monarchical &amp;c. Or mixt; and therefore though it <hi>reform</hi> a nation, yet need not <hi>forme</hi> it: As the water waſhes the veſſel, but complies with the form of the veſſel, be it a barrel or a bottle; and this is the point that the Fathers do much inſiſt upon in their Apologies, that their principles do not fight againſt Magiſtratical authority.</p>
                  <p>3. As I have argued from the principles, ſo let me argue from the intereſt of chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for a Chriſtian hath a greater fraught in this ſhip then another man, His life, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, ſafety, property, peace, is ſecured to him by the common Juſtice, as he is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; His godlineſs and honeſty is ſecured by the indulgence or law of the Magiſtrate as he is a Chriſtian, and this is an excellent couple godlineſſe and honeſty, for honeſty gives credit, and many times protection to godlineſs, for who is he that will harme you? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13. yet if the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56580:183"/> outrage be ſo diabolical as to perſecute the name, and profeſſion of godlineſs coupled with honeſty, then in patience poſſeſs your ſouls, but you muſt needs be ſubject, for this was the caſe of thoſe Chriſtians to whom the Apoſtle writes this leſſon.</p>
                  <p>If the tree drop thorough, you muſt not cut it down, for it's not your tree, and it may yeeld better fruit.</p>
                  <p>If the fire burn the houſe, you muſt not quench all the fire in the town, for the Community receives benefit, and the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of God.</p>
                  <p>Thus far I have ſhowen that neither the principles nor intereſts of Chriſtianity do carry the leaſt tincture of indiſpoſition againſt Magiſtracy, and why then is the ſcripture ſo ſolicitous in inculcating upon them this duty of ſubjection.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The reaſon that reſpects the Chriſtians of thoſe times is, that ſo great was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation offer'd to this profeſſion at that time, that the pot had need to be cooled for running over, never was any religion of any kinde ſo univerſally and implacably enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with cauſleſs outrage; which ſhowes both the diabolical ſpirit of the enemy and the verity of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The other reſpects Chriſtians of all times, for they by their Chriſtianity have
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56580:183"/> ſuch Dignity, priviledges and liberties of ſpiritual nature, that through pride and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption are very obnoxious to be abuſed to carnal liberty, and as the next verſe ſaith, made a cloak of wickedneſs, eſpecially if a wary diſtinction be not kept between obedience and ſubjection; for obedience to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands is often unjuſt, becauſe the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded is unlawfull, but ſubjection reſpects the authority, which is the image of God and not to be reſiſted.</p>
                  <p>So much for the general.</p>
                  <p>The firſt particular reaſon is, That <hi>ſo is the will of God.</hi> I ſhall not enter into diſtinctions about Gods will; here may be conceived <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the will of his pleaſure, according to which his purpoſes, his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and their effects are ordered, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 13. the good and acceptable will of God, which orders our actions and obedience, for obedience reſpects not, as obedience the matter of a command that it be profitable or pleaſant, but the will of the Commander, from whence it hath the denomination of obedience.</p>
                  <p>The will of God is 1. the higheſt reaſon.</p>
                  <p>2. The moſt obliging of a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>3. The moſt proper reaſon for ſubjection.</p>
                  <p>The will of God is the higheſt reaſon, as the command is the higheſt rule, there muſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56580:184"/> be ſome ſupreme will, for there is no order, <hi>ſine relatione ad aliquid primum,</hi> as in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of cauſes; I will hear the heaven, the heaven ſhall hear the earth, the earth ſhall hear the corn, and that ſhall hear <hi>Jezreel, Hoſea</hi> 2. 22. ſo in the ſcale of Magiſtracy, one rank is above another, untill we ariſe up to the ſupreme, for there is in every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth whether in one hand or in more, ſome ſupreme, wherein there muſt be ſome arbitrarineſs in legiſlation or law-making.</p>
                  <p>2. The will of God is moſt obliging of a Chriſtian, whoſe prayer is <hi>fiat voluntas Domini;</hi> It hath the greateſt awe upon him above all intereſts and all reaſons, it is the welſpring of all ſaving grace, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and favour of God accompanies our obedience to his will, the father hath not left me alone <hi>John</hi> 8. 29. for I do alwayes thoſe things that pleaſe him.</p>
                  <p>3. It is the moſt proper, and preponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating reaſon that can be given for this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Magiſtracy and ſubjection.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ordinance of Magiſtracy is of God, the powers that be are ordained of God <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This ordination is for the good of man, for he is the Miniſter of God for good; the heathen could ſay the Common-wealth is not for the Magiſtrate, but he for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56580:184"/> and therefore they are called Healers, Shields, Comers, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It makes all ſufferings tolerable, even though the Magiſtrate uſe us harſhly, for it is the will of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It makes Chriſtianity acceptable to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe it yields ſubjection to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who otherwiſe would be extirpate and rooted out, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And this the firſt reaſon, the ſecond is that the will of God is, that we put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men.</p>
                  <p>In handling of which, I ſhould have hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led theſe points;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There will be calumnies caſt upon Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are ignorant and fooliſh men that calumniate Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Its Gods will that we ſhould ſtop the mouth, and put theſe calumnies to ſilence.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Its practical godlineſs of converſation, of which ſubjection to Authority is a part, that puts to ſilence the mouthes of profane men that are opened againſt Religion; for he ſaith <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>And this point I would have ſpoken a little, to have ſhewn, that it is not an opinionative profeſſion, but a practical converſation that gains reputation to Religion, and cleares off ſeandals; but Religion without honeſty is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56580:185"/> but for the ſtage, brings Infamy from very Heathens; hardens men in their ſins; opens the mouth of ſcandals; cauſes an enemy to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, and heaps diſcomfort on our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>So much for the reaſon, verſe 15. now to the preoccupation of the objection, <hi>We are free,</hi> verſe 16. and the points are three.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That part of Chriſtianity which is moſt obnoxious to abuſe, is Chriſtian liberty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The abuſe of this liberty is to make it, or uſe it for a cloak of wickedneſs, looſeneſs, ſedition.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The right uſe of this liberty is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment and exerciſe of it in Gods ſervice.</p>
                  <p>1. This part is moſt obnoxious to abuſe, the ſound of the name ſuggeſts to carnal ear, a carnal liberty. True liberty is a power to do what we ought, not what we will. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fels Chriſtianity is a free ſtate, but the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of this city of God, this kingdom of Chriſt, are as the city and kingdom is not of this world. A Chriſtian is free from ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a legal ſpirit, by the ſpirit of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the yoak of legal bondage, by Goſpel doctrine, from dominion of ſin, by renewing grace; from condemnation and curſe by the right of Chriſt; and all through the redemption or price that ranſomed him into freedome. But as to his outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, no man his condition is better by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56580:185"/> He that is a ſlave is not made free; He that hath no title is not entitled to another mans property, but a ſanctified uſe of his own. He that is a private man is not made a Ruler, much leſs is a wicked man let looſe to luſt and licentiouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>The bond of filial ſubjection to parents; of ſervants to maſters; of ſubjects to magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates is not diſſolved, but ſtrengthened and ſweetened by Chriſtianity, we are free from dominion of mens luſts, not of mens laws.</p>
                  <p>2. The abuſe of this liberty is to uſe it as a vail or cloak of wickedneſſe, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe under ſuch a cloak is double iniquity. The zelots among the Jews, who were the greateſt vipers that ever breathed, had the Temple, the Religion, the freedom of that people for the cloak of their horrible out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages.</p>
                  <p>And we may juſtly complain, that almoſt the whole piece of Religion is cut out into cloaks, and theſe cloakmen are of many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, their cloaks of many faſhions.</p>
                  <p>The fiery zelot hath a cloak for his fury, the zeal of God.</p>
                  <p>The libertine hath a cloak for his looſneſs of life, Chriſtian liberty.</p>
                  <p>The ſcandalous hath a cloak for his ſcandals, he is free in conſcience.</p>
                  <p>The Politician hath a cloak for his diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56580:186"/> he is made all things to all men, to gain ſome.</p>
                  <p>And theſe cloaks are firſt for hiding their inward pretences or intentions.</p>
                  <p>2. For colouring their abſurd and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>3. For deceiving of ſimple men into their ſnare, by promiſe of ſanctity and liberty.</p>
                  <p>4. For defending their abominable and ſcandalous practiſes, <hi>tantum religio potuit ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere malorum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh Religion! how is thy precious name abuſed to be a ſervant to ſelf ends, a pander to their luſts, a ſtirrup to ambition, a ſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king horſe to their own game, an Ivy-buſh to draw cuſtomers, a painted ſepulcher over ſtinking and rotten bones?</p>
                  <p>3. The right uſe of Chriſtian liberty is the employment and exerciſe of it in Gods ſervice, for Chriſts freemen are Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; as free, but as ſervants of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 18. being made free from ſin, ye became the ſervants of God. Grace is free, but there is no greater obligation to obedience. The law is a law of liberty, but it is a bond of duty; let your freedom enlarge you to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; let your ſervice limit and bound your freedom, <hi>Gal. 5. 13. Brethren ye have bin cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to liberty, only uſe not your liberty for an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:56580:186"/>
                  <p>So much of the Doctrinal matter.</p>
                  <p>The Practical uſe follows.</p>
                  <p>Uſe 1. To encourage Magiſtracy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To encourage the Magiſtrate in accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of this power and in the management of it; for he is the ſword-bearer and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of God for publick good, it's God that hath made the people ſubject to this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and put upon them this bridle of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, for elſe <hi>nullum animal moreſius homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> no creature more froward then man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To regulate the Magiſtrate that he rule for God, otherwiſe he diſſolves that very obedience by which men are bound to him, for it is the univerſal ſence of all men, that we muſt not give the things of God to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> whether it be fit to obey God rather then men, was a ſpeech of natural light ſpoken by <hi>Socrates</hi> before the Apoſtle was born: God and our ſelves and the Magiſtrate too, are injured by ſuch obedience. The <hi>Thebean</hi> legion as they were an eternal example of patience in ſuffering and ſubjection to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſo of no diſobedience to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
                  <p>2. To command the people to ſupport, maintain, incourage, bear the frowardneſs of authority, for it is the will of God; the Magiſtracy may pull down it ſelf by injuſtice
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56580:187"/> and tyranny, but let not Gods ſervants pull down his image; for unſpeakable is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of Anarchy where every thing is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and there are as many tyrants as men, as many laws as wills, the Common-wealth is but <hi>Cyclops</hi> Den, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> &amp;c. and all is turn'd into force, and what remedy is there, and by whom, for as Hiſtories tell us, the ſouldier when he draws the ſword moſt uſually loſeth the ſcabbard, and in a common ſhipwrack no particular man can expect to ſave his own cabbin.</p>
                  <p>3. Abuſe not Chriſtian liberty into looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life, or oppoſition to juſt authority; The Apoſtle above all precautions that, the titles of greater freedom; ſaintſhip and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe are dangerous engines in the hand of pride and luſt and ſelf ends; a Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate hath moſt jealouſie of theſe falſe cloaks.</p>
                  <p>Some diſtinguiſh down Magiſtracy, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Heathen, not the Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, and therefore think that this is to be level'd, as againſt goſpel-freedom, which is againſt the ſence of all Chriſtians ſince <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> and the prayers of all before him. Is not a Chriſtian more apt to preſerve godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and honeſty, which is the Magiſtrates work? Is the Chriſtian Church to be worſe then the Jewiſh, and to have no nurſing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and when the goſpel comes in, muſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56580:187"/> Magiſtracy go out a ſad leſſon: Is it not ſaid <hi>Pſal. 2. be wiſe</hi> therefore <hi>O ye Kings, kiſs the Son,</hi> and muſt that kiſs coſt them, their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms for their wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>But you reply, that a Chriſtian is a law to himſelf, Authority deſtroys this freedom, and this is the foundation of your <hi>utopia.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>This, as the Apoſtle ſaith, is the cloak, but what is under it? we may ſee what, namely, you would get the Magiſtrat's ſword into your own hand, Law your own, Authority your own, no property but yours, no liberty but yours, and then as much of all as you will, and more then enough.</p>
                  <p>Others there are for a fifth Monarchy, and I doubt upon a like deſigne, let us not be taken with new words, Chriſts kingdom doth not come into rank or order with ſecular Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, as to be called fifth or ſixth, for they ſought down another as you know, but my kingdom is not of this world, <hi>elſe would my children fight,</hi> this kingdom of Chriſt is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſet up <hi>Dan. 2, 24. in the dayes of theſe kings</hi> ſaith the Text, Meſſiah the Prince is the king, and he rules his ſaints, and therefore it is a

                  <p>God ordains the Magiſtracy which we muſt neceſſarily obey, in things lawful; you deſign the Magiſtrate that we may the more willingly ſubmit, and ſo there is a divine and humane creation both.</p>
                  <p>2. To you, nameleſs Sir, into whoſe hand the Lord Mayor that now is ſhall reſign up the ſword of his authority, which with much wiſdom and moderation he hath thus far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted and honoured;</p>

                  <p>Be you incouraged to give up your ſelf to publick uſe, and to the intereſt of this renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed City; neither betraying her liberties through cowardize, nor hazarding them in raſhneſs: And if there ſhould ariſe croſs winds under your government, remember that you are Pilo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And let your courage and diligence run out againſt thoſe flagitious ſins that undermine the peace of our Common-wealth, ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drunkenneſs, whoredome and their neſts; I ſay their neſts, for the beſt reformation of ſuch birds is to pull down their neſts.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe there are amongſt us a certain ſort of Pagans in Chriſtendom, that uſe not the means of faith, but under the colour of liberty, take a liberty for no conſcience, for luſt and filthineſs; remember that, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is the firſt word of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which God committed to parents, to maſters, to governours to ſee obſerved; for he that is a Magiſtrate without care of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may be compared rather to a herdſman of cattle then accounted a governor of chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>It may be your ſword will not reach all of this ſort, but you muſt know, that the moral acts of a Magiſtrate may work much, his tongue, his frown, his word of counſel and reproof, in all which he may worthily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his zeal for God.</p>
                  <p>And finally, let Magiſtracy and Miniſtry ſupport one the other; for when one of theſe twins decay and dye, the other will not long ſurvive in any ſlouriſhing condition.</p>

                  <p>In the Anatomy of this text, there will ariſe four conſiderable parts, which I will form up into as many points of Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>1 <hi>Who</hi> the Remembrancer is, whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth charge <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>to put them in minde,</hi> and that is <hi>Titus,</hi> and all Colleagues with him in the Miniſterial Office, the Apoſtle one of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt authority Eccleſiaſtical, provides for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the higheſt authority Political in the Common-wealth, and if the people will ſubmit to the <hi>Miniſter</hi> of Doctrine, it may be preſumed they will ſubject themſelves to the Magiſtrate, who is the <hi>Miniſter</hi> of God for government, this firſt part I ſum up into this point.</p>
                  <p>1 That the Miniſter of the Word ought in his place and office to endeavour that the Scepter of Majeſty in the higheſt, the Sword of Magiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal authority in the lower hand, be kept in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their rights and dues, which are ſubjection and obedience of the people.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>Whoſe</hi> Remembrancer the Miniſter is, and they are Chriſtians by their profeſſion, who come
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56580:195"/> to his crib to feed, Not heathens, who neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any authority of God in the Miniſter, nor are much moved to this duty of obedience for conſcience towards God, but rather for fear, whereof (I mean the puniſhment) the Magiſtrate himſelf, not the Miniſter, is the proper executioner or Miniſter <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſaith the text, <hi>put them in minde,</hi> and ſo the ſecond point is.</p>
                  <p>No Chriſtian who is by his Chriſtianity <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niceps Coeli,</hi> a freeman of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> hath by his Chriſtianity any priviledge that may exempt him from, or looſen the bands of that civil Authority which is over him, no, though it remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>3 Theſe things wherewith Chriſtians muſt be charged in relation to civil authority are ſumm'd up under two heads, <hi>ſubjection, obedience,</hi> put them in minde <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>The one</hi> of theſe calls for ſubjection to the function or office, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your ſubordination, that you are placed in a lower orbe, and therefore what the Higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may look for of inferiour ſubjects, what the maſter though crabbed and crooked, may expect of his ſervants, that is, <hi>ſubjection,</hi> you muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, <hi>Rom. 13. 1. 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14. Titus 2. 9. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 18, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The other</hi> of theſe calls for obedience to their Laws and Commands, and that is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which though in the notion of the word it ſignifie to <hi>obey Magiſtrates</hi> or Rulers, and is ſo turned in our laſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56580:195"/> Engliſh Tranſlation in this place, yet is applyed to obedience to God, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 29, 32. or unto our liſtenings to the perſwaſions of men, though no Magiſtrates, <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 21. I confeſs, that ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and obedience in common intention of ſpeech do not much differ.</p>
                  <p>When the word <hi>ſubject</hi> is ſet alone without a ſecond, it includes obedience, <hi>Rom. 13. 1. 1 Pet. 2. 13. Titus 2. verſe 5. &amp; 9 Luke 2. 51. Jam.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
                  <p>When the word <hi>obedient</hi> is ſet alone without a ſecond it comprehends ſubjection, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 29, &amp;c. (I mean this of a voluntary and not enforced ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 17) But when both theſe words are uſed together in the ſame place, as they are in this text, they may be more accurately diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht.</p>
                  <p>Subjection relates to the perſon, that is ſupream in <hi>place, function office,</hi> and the contrary, or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite hereunto is reſiſtance; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, are oppoſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2. that is, <hi>ſubjection</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſistance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obedience</hi> properly relates to the Magiſtrate his <hi>Edicts, Laws,</hi> lawful and honeſt <hi>commands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it hath ordinarily been pleaded by honeſt diſobeyers of unjuſt commands; We refuſe not to be ſubject, we reſiſt not, we oppoſe not the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; therefore we ſubmit our ſelves to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the Magiſtrates infliction without reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; but we dare not, we will not perform the command enjoyned, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 18. and thus its
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56580:196"/> plain, there may be ſubjection to juſt authority (for that is good and lawful) when there is not obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto unjuſt commands: the one being ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God; when the command may be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to, and againſt Gods.</p>
                  <p>The third point is <hi>the ſum of that debt,</hi> which the ſubject owes to the civil Magiſtrate, is to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him in his place or office, and to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to him in his commands; I might ſay <hi>honeſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi> but that I look not to be carped, no more then the Apoſtles did, that gave this command to ſervants, to obey their maſters <hi>in all things, Col.</hi> 3. 22. nor yet (though I acknowledge the ſubject, or the ſervant to be (as he ſaid) <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inſtrument) would I open a gap for every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet &amp; unſober diſpute, that on purpoſe, to ſhift off the Magiſtrates or the Maſters commands, may think it enough to pretend <hi>they are not honest,</hi> and ſo the Maſter ſhall indeed be the <hi>Maſter,</hi> but the ſervant is the <hi>Judge,</hi> the Magiſtrate is the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi> but the ſubject is the <hi>Judge,</hi> which indeed he is <hi>of his own action,</hi> by the judgement of <hi>Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but not of the command by the judgement of <hi>Authority,</hi> for that would be an eaſie way to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn both authority and obedience, and to leave all to the beſt diſputant.</p>
                  <p>4 <hi>Thoſe to whom</hi> this debt is to be paid, are the principalities &amp; powers, they are <hi>all</hi> that are in rank of Magiſtracy reſpectively, both the Higheſt and the Subordinate in this Scale; <hi>Principalities and Powers,</hi> ſaith the text, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>From the firſt of them, the Miniſters duty to put the people in minde of their obedience to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracie you may learn.</p>
                  <p>1 This duty is charged upon the Miniſter as the publick remembrancer of the people to whom is committed the diſpenſation of ſound doctrine, <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 1. ſerving to keep them right in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their relations towards one another, and therefore it appears that God will honour the ſtanding Miniſtery with this publick ſervice, that the flock may not ſtand at any mans <hi>courteſie</hi> that will feed them (I ſay not poiſon them) but expect it from ſome hand of ſtanding duty, and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that our Antimagiſtratical men, do for the ſame reaſon cry down the Miniſtery, as <hi>Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> obſerved the ſheep were required to deliver up their Dogs that wakened them by their batking at the comming of Wolves or Thieves.</p>
                  <p>2 A faithful Miniſtery is very uſeful to Civil Magiſtracie in diſcharge of this office of putting the people in minde of their ſubjection to authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for commonly people are querulous and waſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly froward againſt authority, and ſubjection to mans nature is grievous, good ſervice doth the Miniſter of Gods Word do for the Magiſtrate, who is alſo called the Miniſter of God in bearing of his ſword, and let theſe two Miniſters like twins ſupporting one the other flouriſh and live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56580:198"/> good ſervice doth the Miniſter alſo for the people in warning them of their duty, and of their doing it for conſcience ſake, for heathen King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Policies that want this office of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers do uſually more obey for wrath then conſcience. Oh! let not the Miniſter of the Word who is their Remembrancer cut the girdle of this relation between Magiſtrate and ſubject by blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one up into Tyranny, or laying him low into contempt or contumely, or by pulling away the other, <hi>viz. the ſubject</hi> as an Ivy from the tree that ſupports and ſuſtains it, for ſurely you ought not to turn your <hi>host</hi> out of dores, that gives the Goſpel houſe-room and hoſpitality in his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, no though he were a Heathen, <hi>vae ſoli,</hi> wo be to either of them that is alone, I know and am ſorry that the Pulpit which is the Watch-tower whence this Remembrancer gives warning, is ſometimes ſo partial and ſo paſſionate as rather to ſeem to blow <hi>Sheba</hi> his Trumpet, or to throw dirt in the face of Authority, for I believe that God hath put this office on the Goſpel Miniſter, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſweeten and make the Goſpel acceptable to States and Magiſtrates, which otherwiſe as a <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefeau</hi> would (to ſpeak humanely) have been hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of all places.</p>

                     </gap>, for they are Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in place of Magiſtracy, and the Apoſtle ſeems to hold to this rule, for he checks his own miſtake of calling <hi>Ananias</hi> the High Prieſt, <hi>whited wall;</hi> by alledging that text of ſpeaking evil of the Ruler of his people; and yet it is probable he knew not that he came into that place by lineal ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, but irregularly and ſurreptitiouſly, as moſt of them had done ſince the time of the <hi>Macchabees,</hi> and our Saviour told the captious <hi>Jews,</hi> that they receiving <hi>Caeſars</hi> Coine a ſigne of his Soverignty muſt in reaſon give to <hi>Caeſar</hi> what was his.</p>
                  <p>3 God is the countenancer and approver of Civil Magiſtracy, as appears in that he will have the Miniſter of his Word to put the people in mind to be ſubject to it, for it is the <hi>ordinance of God, Rom.</hi> 13. 2. and as the <hi>Romans</hi> made the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes

                  <p>What muſt we turne our direction croſſe to the Apoſtle, and put Chriſtians in mind not to be ſubject to Chriſtian Magiſtrates, and make them incapable of Government of Chriſtians that are moſt fit for it, and for whom we muſt pray that we may live, a peaceable life in all godlineſſe and

                  <p>From the third Point obſerve:</p>
                  <p>That this great debt of ſubjection and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be duly paid without grudging, two things call for payment. 1 The command of God whoſe Officer the Magiſtrate is. 2 Your own good by whom you ſleepe, you walke, you are maſters of your own, you are Maſters of your lives, you hold all theſe at this Rent-ſervice, your ſubjection. There is a certain light in mans minde, that tels them they cannot live together in ſociety without this <hi>nail,</hi> the mutinous members that roſe up againſt the belly for eating up their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours were quieted by this oratory, that it did but digeſt the meat for them, nothing more pernicions then the inferiour his refuſal of obedience to the Magiſtrate, eſpecially you that are Chriſtians have <hi>moſt benefit</hi> by Magiſtracy, for you are expoſed to more envy of wicked men by your profeſſion, and are by your principles more unarmed from private revenge.</p>
                  <p>Beſides that, you hold your Religion, your greateſt treaſure in peaceable poſſeſſion by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection and protection, except the Magiſtrate
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56580:201"/> ſhall profeſs himſelf a <hi>Gallio</hi> that cares for no ſuch thing, or be like <hi>Eſarhaddon,</hi> that ſent into the Kingdom of ſubdued <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a mixture or galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maufrey of ſeveral Religions in deſigne, <hi>ut in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune conſulere non ſineret religionum diverſitas,</hi> that is, That diverſity of Religion might hinder common counſels.</p>
                  <p>But this Province, I confeſs, properly belongs to the Sovereigne, though for the executive part to every Magiſtrate in his order &amp; place, as the cauſe of the falſe prophet pertained to the Supream Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, therefore our Saviour ſaith (as <hi>Cunaeus</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves)<note place="margin">Cunaeus de Repub.</note> that a Prophet could not periſh out of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi> Blaſphemy hurts the name, Hereſie the Truth, Idolatry the worſhip of God, of theſe the Magiſtrate is as he is called the heir of reſtraint, <hi>Judges</hi> 18. 17. for in this the Prince as a Prince may ſerve God and cannot do it as he is as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man, I beſpeak this at the Magiſtrates hand, I mean <hi>reſtraint,</hi> for that God expects it at his hand is plain by that, that Idolatry was ſet up in <hi>Micah</hi> his houſe, <hi>Judges</hi> 17. 8. becauſe at that time there was no King in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Thoſe that ſaid, <hi>Quid Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratoricum Eccleſia</hi> (the <hi>Donatiſts</hi>) are juſtly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided by <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that when the Emperour was againſt them, they cryed that cry, When for them they changed their note as their own partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and intereſt led them, as all ſuch kinde of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, will ſtill do at this day.</p>
                  <p>The Magiſtrate will puniſh corporal adultery,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56580:202"/> will prohibit the ſale of poyſonous Drugs, and there is no great reaſon, but that the calamity of the Common-wealth may be prevented, which may accure by depravation of Religion, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Reſpublica detrimentum capit,</hi> as Hiſtory and Experience may inform; as for the Miniſters way, it is conviction, ſo Chriſt dealt with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees, and the Churches way is <hi>binding</hi> by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercion; and the Magiſtrates way, is reſtraint an co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercion in a civil way.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrine of this Church always was, that the intermedling of the Civil Magiſtrate <hi>in ſacris,</hi> was not that of <hi>Uzzia,</hi> but of <hi>Hezekiah, Joſiah, &amp;c.</hi> not to perform them, but to ſee them done, as <hi>Reinolds</hi> againſt <hi>Hart</hi> ſaith. The Inferences from the fourth point are theſe which follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 To put you in minde of the <hi>Extent</hi> of this duty of ſubjection and obedience, it reaches from him that is in higheſt, to him that is of loweſt rank in Magiſtracy, all that have the ſtamp or mark of authority upon them, though the money differ in value, yet there is a ſuperſcription on the leaſt piece, which ſpeaks the ſame authority, the image of <hi>Caeſar</hi> was upon a peny.

                  <p>2 The Serpent beguiled the woman <hi>Eve,</hi> for the woman <hi>by the Serpent,</hi> the man <hi>by the woman,</hi> the ſtronger by the weaker veſſel, the husband by the wife; as the Angler takes the ſmall fiſh by a worm, and then that ſmall fiſh taken doth become a bait for the greater fiſh; ſo it is ſaid of his agents they lead captive ſilly women, they <hi>deceive the hearts of the ſipmle,</hi> Rom. 16. 18</p>

                  <p>From the firſt part of the text, the thing feared, I take up two Doctrines.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>The ſimplicity that is in Chriſt, is to be holden untainted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>The corruption of the minde is the cauſe of devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or receſs from that ſimplicity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I begin with the firſt.</p>
                  <p>The virgin chaſtity of the ſoul eſpouſed to Chriſt Jeſus, which loves not to be painted with any <hi>Fucus</hi> of meretricious gaudineſs, ſimpleneſs or ſimplicity in vulgar ſpeech, and ſometimes in Scripture ſounds towards <hi>fooliſh credulity</hi> or want of wit.</p>
                  <p>But in the true notion of the word it ſignifies a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56580:211"/> 
                     <hi>freedom</hi> from <hi>compoſition,</hi> and ſo we call the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Gods being, which is without all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
                  <p>Moſt commonly it is a <hi>freedom</hi> from <hi>mixture</hi> of heterogeneal things which might adulterate puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In Doctrine unlearnedneſs, in faith unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedneſs in love ſincerity, in worſhip chaſtity, in life and converſation integrity, do make up that we call ſimplicity of Chriſt, which I ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiate into theſe three.</p>

                  <p>But now I ſpeak of the ſimplicity of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the Doctrine of the Goſpel which is a miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that exceeds in glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9. and which the Angels ſtoop down to pry into, and yet is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt as fooliſhneſs with the wiſdom of this world that W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is a quinteſſence above al clementary lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and tranſcendent above every predicament, hath been entertained with <hi>Stand thou here, or ſit under my footſtool;</hi> whereas that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls vain Philoſophy, and <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Here is no mixture of Jewiſh rites, as if we would look for Chriſt in that manger wherein he lay when he was a babe; the bird is now hatcht, and the eggſhel lies empty.</p>
                  <p>Here is no corrival of mans works to ſpoile this ſimplicity, there remains no place for them, as they are meritorious, for that ſets them in the chair of Chriſt; nor as they are motives of God to juſtifie, for that ſets them in the place of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, nor as conditions of the Covenant, for that ſets them in the place of faith, but as they are fruits of holineſs, for that ſets them in their own place, aſſigned to them by this Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>2 Simplicity of worſhip, which is called ſpirit, and truth <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 23. not Judaicall and ſhadowiſh, not Samaritan &amp; idolatrous, but ſpiritual and inward.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle calls the Jewiſh types, which were rich, beggarly Elements, we have them in the rich plainneſs of the Goſpel. In matter of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that of <hi>Auſtin</hi> is the truth, and <hi>Socrates</hi> had ſeen it before, <hi>colendus eſt quomodo ſe colendum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceperit,</hi> as himſelf hath commanded.</p>

                  <p>God muſt ſtamp that worſhip as ſhall be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, man is apt to indulge his eye in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; It's the hardeſt thing (ſaith one) to leave our eye and fancie behind us (as <hi>Abraham</hi> did his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, when we go up into the monnt to ſacrifice.) The ſpiritual part of religion, is the hardeſt part.</p>
                  <p>If we look into <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and ſee how the dreſſe of worſhip was changed, by degrees we ſhal finde, that it became at length <hi>quaſi reductus in Eccleſiam Judaiſmus,</hi> unbecoming the purity of this virgin.</p>
                  <p>3 The ſimplicity of life; It was an excellent teſtimoniall ſubſcribed by the Apoſtle his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, we have had our converſation in this world.</p>
                  <p>The form of godlineſs, is but a Mathematicall body, conſiſting of lineaments onely: Religion is practicall and alwayes married to honeſty and righteouſneſs towards men; religious diſhoneſty is worſe than a Chriſtian married to a Heathen; in the times we live, that ſaying is too true, <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus mundus exercet hiſtrioniam,</hi> all men almoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe and act parts.</p>
                  <p>Men either make it a ſtalking horſe to their own game, a footſtool to their ends, a covert of gold
<pb facs="tcp:56580:212"/> for their filthy deſignes, or lodge it onely in the cock-loft of a cold brain, and not in the warme room of affections.</p>
                  <p>And the ſimplicity of Chriſt, is broken into a multiplicity of ſenſes and wayes.</p>
                  <p>Let this Point for uſe recommend to Miniſters and people both the ſimplicity of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>1 Simplicity for the matter of the Doctrine, I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, faith he that had ſitten at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel;</hi> for (though that of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> be true, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>We muſt ſet bread before hungry ſouls, and not be like the School-men, that ſet men upon gnawing hard ſtones.</p>
                  <p>All learning may be ſpent upon the ſimplicity of the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>In breaking down ſtrong holds, meeting with ſubtilty of mens hearts, raiſing up the dejected Spirit proſtrate under ſin, counter-mining the methods and ſtratagems of the Devill, and you will finde that the old <hi>Adam</hi> in mens hearts is too hard for young <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and <hi>who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56580:214"/> is a part of original fin, for it is the corruption of Goſpel-truth formerly received, eſpecially do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinall corruption: and therefore the Apoſtle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaid, Chriſt, the ſame yeſterday, to day and for ever; preſently adds, <hi>Be not carried away by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and ſtrange Doctrines,</hi> Heb. 13. 9.</p>
                     <p>The Text affords me three things, for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of this Point.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The corruption of minde here feared, is of them that have received the virgin truth; a ſad thing that they that bloſſom ſo faire, ſhould be blaſted or cankered; it is not corruption of life he feares, but of minde; many are tainted in their intellectuals, that make a fair ſhew in morals; the Apoſtle propheſies of a time that will come, <hi>That men will not indure ſound doctrine</hi> (they will not imbrace, nay, they will not indure it) <hi>but will turn away their eares from the truth, and be turned to fables,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 3.</p>

                        <p n="1">1 The minde being the upper region, is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the lower region; paſſions, luſts, intereſts by-ends, do bribe the minde to be advocate for errour, and miſ-biaſſe the judgement; the ſtaffe that is ſtreight of it ſelf, ſeems crooked in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by refraction of the ſpecies, or duplicity of the medium; and we know that our eye or brain is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered by ſuffuſions of choler, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from a foule ſtomack.</p>

                        <p n="3">3 A meer notion, which is like light without heat, a winter-ſnow, a thing without ſenſe, and feeling of any powerfull operation, and work of truth upon the heart is but a ſlender guard from this corruption of the minde; a man without much adoe recedes from barren notions; he that feels the warmth and power is not eaſily changed; they did not receive the truth with love of the truth, and therefore God gave them up to effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of errour, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 A ſatiety or diſlike of ſaving doctrine: when novelty is preferred, becauſe it's new, and ancient truth, like an old Miniſter, now adayes is leſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded; the ſtomack is crude and queaſie, and ſo reliſhes traſh better then wholſome food.</p>

                     <head>Uſe.</head>
                     <p>For the Uſe of this Doctrine, let me beſpeak you in the words of S. <hi>Peter, Epiſt. 2. Cap. 3. Verſ. penult. Take heed, lest being led away by the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the wicked,</hi> (or of lawleſſe men) <hi>ye fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſſe.</hi> This Caveat I might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force upon you from divers Topicks or places; as namely, the dangerouſneſſe of this diſeaſe which ſeizes on the head, from whence (as ſaith the Greek Proverb) the fiſh doth firſt begin to be corrupted, as alſo from the eaſineſſe of being infected, and from the difficulty of the cure: but having ſpoke enough of the firſt of theſe, I will onely uſe a few words concerning the two latter.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 It's as eaſie to be infected, as it is for ſheep to catch the rot by feeding in rotten paſtures; and our experience ſhews us, that one that angles with ſuch baits, catches more fiſh in a week, than preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, and the ſimplicity of him will catch in ſome yeers, for errour hath ſomething in us, as he that gave the reaſon for the faſter growth of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56580:217"/> weeds than ſweet herbs, ſaid that the ſoile was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall mother to the one, and but ſtep-mother to the other.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 There is no ſimplicity of truth, a multiplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of errour; the ſtreight line between point and point can be but one; the oblique lines, many; therefore it is eaſie to hang upon one tender-hook or other, that look ſo many and even contrary wayes.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Errour is many times more ſpecious to our ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, proud, corrupt reaſon, than the truth of God, whoſe depths and myſteries cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be anſwered, then with, <hi>Tu quis es?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4 The mint-maſters of errour do uſually faſhion their doctrines to fleſh-pleaſing, and man-pleaſing; ye ſhall not eaſily finde that falſe prophets did preach the burdens of the Lord, but rather as <hi>Peter</hi> obſerves, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19. they promiſe liberty, which is ſo taking a thing, that looking humane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we may wonder that Chriſt preaching repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſelf-deniall, the croſſe, ſhould gain any.</p>
                     <div type="part">
                        <head>So much for the eaſineſs of being infected; then next a word for the difficulty of the cure.</head>
                        <p>1 The cure is difficult, becauſe men are hard to be convinced of the ſin and falſhood, il with zeal &amp; open profeſſion they have maintained it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> (as the hiſtory relates) would hardly be drawn to admit of any
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56580:218"/> receſs from their former errours, <hi>ne viderentur er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſe,</hi> leſt they might ſeem to have erred, and ſo weaken the credit of all they held before, as the crack made in Ice, uſeth to runne further, then where it is firſt made.</p>
                        <p>But if in puniſhment upon them that receive not the truth in love, God do give men up to efficacy of errour, or do otherwiſe <hi>recompence their errour,</hi> by delivering them up to vile affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and luſts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 27. who ſhall then pull off that fearfull ſeal of God, that ſeals them up in ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, and under a reprobate minde.</p>
                        <p>2 Therein men are great lovers of their own fancies; <hi>Amat quiſque quod à ſe repertum eſt,</hi> no mother but loves her own babe.</p>
                        <p>3 A conceit that errors of minde are not ſin, as morall ſins are, but there are diſeaſes of the head, as well as ſeated in other parts.</p>
                        <p>And certainly, theſe capitall diſtempers do great prejudice to practicall holineſs, being like ſuckers that bear no fruit, but do divert and draw away the ſap from the fruit-bearing branches.</p>
                        <p>So much for the firſt part, the object of the fear, leſt the mindes of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſhould be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted from the ſimplicity of Chriſt: the ſecond part is the reſemblance of falſe teachers to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and this manner of beguiling <hi>Eve</hi> by ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, leſt as the ſerpent, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 That the defection, the corruption of men principled with pure doctrine is feared. Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principles are not ſo much to be ſcanned by curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of reaſon, as received in ſimplicity of faith.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Apoſtle alledges the moſt ancient exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of corruption of minde that is in the world; that which men call <hi>New Light</hi> is many times but ſome exploded errour furbiſht up, and old wayes are but acted once again. There is properly no new truth, but there may be new diſcoveries.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 What a ſharp compariſon doth he uſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble falſe teachers? unto the devil his firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument uſed by him; and therefore let no man temeraciouſly ſay, <hi>they are holy men,</hi> they aime at more refined degree of holineſſe then others: for it's no wonder, ſaith the Apoſtle, that if Satan be transformed into an Angel of light, his Miniſters alſo be transformed or diſguiſed, as the Miniſters of righteouſneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:56580:219"/>4 The Serpent took <hi>Eve</hi> at the beginning, and ſubtilly raviſht her of her integrity, we muſt look to our ſelves; it's the uſual time to ſet upon us in our infancy of knowledge, either to diſgrace the truth newly brought to light, or to diſplant it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it do take root.</p>

                     <p>Their ſubtilty may be obſerved in the Serpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine which they imitate.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The ſerpent ſet upon the weaker ſex, and the Apoſtle ſaith, they lead captive ſilly women.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 They are ſubtil in being modeſt at firſt, <hi>millea erroris ſunt verecunda, Hath God ſaid,</hi> Gen. 3. ſaith the ſerpent, the deceiver begins with <hi>queries</hi> rather then down-right aſſertions.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 They will take their riſe from Gods Word, and rather wreſt then deny it, as the ſerpent here perverted thoſe words, <hi>the knowledge of good and evil,</hi> to another ſenſe and meaning.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 They promiſe magnificent and great things, they promiſe them liberty, ſaith <hi>Peter. 2 Pet. 2. 18. Ye ſhall be as gods,</hi> ſaith the ſerpent, what great bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are uſually ſpoken of glory, joy, familiarity with God, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 They comply with mans pride, with ſelf, &amp;c. and fit the bait to the fiſh. They allure through
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56580:219"/> the luſts of the fleſh, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 They draw a man from practical obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to extrinſecal, and meer empty ſpeculations (for the theorie is pleaſant and eaſie, but the truth is bitter.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 They bring points of faith, to the bar &amp; teſt of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious reaſon: God in the prohibition of this tree, had ſhewn much arbitrarineſs of will, to make probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mans obedience, &amp; therefore they ought not to have been arraigned <hi>coram non Judice,</hi> as neither the cleer points of faith.</p>
                     <p>The time puls me by the eare, and therefore for cloſe, as deceivers have the Serpents ſubtilty, ſo get you the Serpents wiſdom, and if I were to preſcribe prophylacticks or preſervatives I would exhort you, 1 To hold the head, and ſo to fortifie the vitals from this epidemick infection, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. 2 To purſue practicall doctrine, ſolid meat, and let alone theſe ſweet meats; the tree of knowledge is fair to look on, the tree of life better to feed on. 3 Affect not things above the Word, a holineſs, a zeal, a knowledge, above what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: <hi>Eve</hi> went ſome what further then Gods Word gave warrant when ſhe replied, <hi>neither ſhall ye touch it:</hi> ſo there are many will ſay, This is the holier way, this is the better, not having any Word for it. 4. Avoid the houſe of infection, the Fowlers net, <hi>From ſuch turn away,</hi> faith the Scripture, if the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will confer with the Serpent; you ſee what comes on it, it's the itch and pride after novelties that expoſes us to temptations.</p>

Though errour be old, yet truth is firſt. All corruptions of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are deviations from their inſtitution, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the falſe copy muſt be corrected by the true ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, The inſtitution of Chriſt is the certain Rule; He inſtituted it for a Communion, therefore O <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> your diviſions and contempt of the poor is unſuitable. He inſtituted it as a Sacrament of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood for ſpiritual repaſt, therefore your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance and common uſe of it at your feaſts, is not agreeable to the nature and uſe of it, as the ſtandard diſcovers falſe weights and meaſures, and a ſtraight rule, a crooked line, ſo the inſtitution of our Lord, corruptions. The Popiſh-maſſe would not be found in the maſſe, if it were tried by this Rule; but we muſt diſtinguiſh between Chriſts inſtitution of this Sacrament, and his celebration of it, though at the ſame time. The inſtitution ſhews the nature and uſe of it, and abides as a perpetual Rule, <hi>He took bread, he bleſt, he broke, he gave,</hi> &amp;c. His celebration of it was by reaſon of the Paſſeover attended by very many occaſional circumſtances, after Supper, in a private room, in ſuch a geſture, to ſuch a number, in

The Apoſtle did not, durſt not deliver but what he had received; but they that have leſſe power than the Apoſtle, dare deliver what they received not, and by adding or ſubſtracting, do plainly finde fault with Gods own model: Why ſhould the Papiſt give into the mouth of his Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant a whole wafer, but that he is afraid to break the bread leaſt ſome looſe crums ſhould fall? Why doth he cheat the people wholly of the Cup, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pretence that a drop of the bloud might be ſhed or ſpilt? May we not think that they are too nice, and more ſcrupulous than Chriſt, at whoſe breaking bread there might fall crums, and in the Apoſtles drinking, drops from the cup?

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56580:248"/> hath been practiſed in the Chriſtian Churches, till this very time and year, being 1500 years at leaſt. The Miniſter takes the bread, and likewiſe takes the Cup.

                        <hi>The Authour of this inſtitution is the Lord Jeſus.</hi> The conſent of all the Evangeliſts that write the Hiſtory,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56580:250"/> puts this out of all controverſie; Chriſt was perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent both celebrating and inſtituting this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; He is <hi>res Sacramenti,</hi> the thing of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>Author Sacramenti,</hi> the Authour of the Sacrament, the feaſt-maker, and the feaſt; <hi>Out of this pierced ſide</hi> (as <hi>Austin</hi> alludes) <hi>there came forth both bloud and water, the two Sacraments of the Church; He took the bread, he bleſt, he brake it, he gave it, it may well be called the Lords Supper, yea the Lord is the Supper, This is my body, this is my bloud.</hi>

The Lords day, and the Lords Supper are particularly in Scripture called by<note place="margin">Rev. 1. 10. 1 Cor. 11.</note> his name, The Lords; The Lords day <hi>ex illius reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectione feſtivitatem ſuam habere coepit,</hi> took its feſtivity<note place="margin">Epiſt. 119.</note> from his Reſurrection, as <hi>Auſtin;</hi> The Lords Supper is the memorial of his death, ſo his death and reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, a Supper, and a day to memorize them.</p>
                        <p>As he is Lord, ſo his Laws binde whatſoever they be, though <hi>Abraham</hi> be commanded to kill his ſonne, for the Laws of God have not their obligation from the quality of the Law, but from the authority of the Lord the Law-giver: As he is Jeſus a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, ſo his Laws are benefits and liberties tending to ſalvation; as the Laws of your City are freedoms, and your freedoms laws, ſo you obey them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The old Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had a Table-Sacrament, the Paſſeover, and Chriſt will have the Goſpel-Church to have a Table-Sacrament too, this Supper; but as before Chriſt their Sacrifices and Sacraments were all bloudy: So when Chriſt the ſubſtance of all Sacrifices and Sacraments hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, the Sacraments of the Goſpel and Sacrifices are unbloudy: Many Divines ſhew the conveniency

The Papiſts, as to their Prieſts and ſome Kings or Princes, will allow bread and wine, but as to the common people, bread or wine they ſay by concomitancy, the blood is in the bread virtually, and ſo they ſhut up the wounds of Chriſt by their dry Maſs. But Chriſt would repreſent himſelf here not as a Lamb, but a Lamb ſacrificed and ſlain; and therefore the blood is ſevered from the body, as the money is not a priſoners ranſom, while it lies in the cheſt, but when it's paid: So the blood of Chriſt as ſhed is our ranſom. As <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs had a type of Chriſt, Manna which they did eat, and the rock alſo of which they drank, ſo have we the memorials of his body and blood, that we may eat and drink.</p>

                        <p>And which is the ſumme of all that may be ſaid on this point, ſince the Lord was pleaſed even under the Goſpel to continue that old way of Fellowſhip and Communion with his Church, by entertaining them at his own Table, upon his own chear in an Ordinance of eating and drinking; as he alwaies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to feaſt with him upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of the Sacrifices in token of followſhip: and the very Heathens did by feaſting on their Sacrifices teſtifie their fellowſhip with their Idols, as is plain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 18, 19, 20. I ſee not how more fit materials could be uſed then Bread and Wine, which as they beſt ſtand with the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, ſo they are the moſt common and neceſſary atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants in all feaſts, and do both together ſet forth that full and perfect nouriſhment which we finde in Chriſt.</p>

                        <p>So much of the Elements, Bread and Wine.</p>
                        <p>Now I proceed to the Rites or Actions; and firſt them of Chriſts uſing, in which you are to uſe your eye: as in the Word preached God ſpeaks to your ear, ſo here he ſpeaks to your eye. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a viſible Word, and therefore I hold it requiſite that the Communicant be within ſight of the Elements and Actions, that he may ſee the bread and the wine, Taken, Bleſſed, Broken, Poured forth; and not in corners and holes, whence he hath not the actions under command of his eye. Not that I deny but a blinde man may receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that all means of ſpirituall impreſſion muſt be uſed. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes, the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> Exod. 24. 8.</p>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:56580:264"/>
                        <p>The firſt Action of Chriſt is, <hi>He took bread, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife after ſupper, the cup,</hi> ſo <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo <hi>Luke. He took the bread, he took the cup,</hi> ſo <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark:</hi> of the two Elements the Bread is firſt taken both by Chriſt, and by the Communicant: This order is to be held by the conſent of all the four Writers; And of Chriſts Action, let us Note</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That Chriſt took the Bread into his hands, he took the Cup into his hands, obſerving the rite and cuſtom then uſed, and gave thanks over the Bread, holding it in his hands, and ſo over the Cup, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it in his hands: This is the firſt ſtep towards the ſeparating and ſetting apart the Elements; he took them in his hand, ſee there was a ſolemn rite that the <hi>pater familias</hi> did uſe to take into his hands and bleſs theſe principall parts of the meal or feaſt. The taking of the Lamb was the firſt action towards the Paſchall, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 2, 5, 21.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That Chriſt took and bleſt the Bread and the Cup ſeverally, one after the other: He took Bread and bleſt, and pronounced, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he took the Cup and bleſt, and pronounced, <hi>This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood:</hi> The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> expreſs it, <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe confirm it; and if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, the very rule and uſage amongſt the Jewes to bleſſe them ſeverally, would prove it to us.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But whether there was any intervall of time between his taking and bleſſing the Bread and the Wine, is a harder knot: <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> ſay, <hi>As they were eating,</hi> or as they did eat, <hi>he took Bread: Luke</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>After they had ſupped he took the

The riſe<note place="margin">Gretius in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 26.</note> was, that while they were eating, not the Paſſeover Lamb (for ſo all that Chriſt did was after ſupper) but the <hi>post coenam</hi> or after ſupper, the ſecond courſe, and toward the end thereof, the Maſter took bread and bleſt and brake it, and diſtributed it with a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the bread of affliction in <hi>Egypt;</hi> then at the very cloſe, and after all eating, the Cup was taken and bleſt, what intervall of time went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween I know not. <hi>Non conſtat,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Calvin in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56580:265"/> the thing being meerly occaſionall, is not obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, but indifferent: We pronounce the words of ſignification, <hi>This is my Body, This Cup is,</hi> &amp;c. ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, but we do not diſtribute the Bread before we bleſs the Wine; that Chriſt did occaſionally to the Rite.</p>

                        <p>For the firſt, Whether Chriſt did with his own hand deliver the bread and cup into the hand of every particular Communicant, <hi>viz.</hi> immediately? We muſt look ſtill to the rite or cuſtome uſed in the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Supper; and if we conſider that well, we ſhall ſee it probable, that the <hi>Pater-familias</hi> did not riſe from his diſcumbency or poſture of lying, to go to every particular perſon, or that every one came to his hand, for there might be twenty at the Table, and not all within the reach of his hand, nor do we finde that Chriſt roſe up, nor that they roſe up to receive them. He ſaid, <hi>Take ye, eat ye, Drink all of it;</hi> and though he might give the Cup to the next into his hand, yet his ſpeech is general to them all, and ſo the bread and the cup paſt in the <hi>Poſtcaenium,</hi> or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Supper. <hi>Maldonate</hi> ſaith, He reacht out the<note place="margin">Maldona <hi>in</hi> Mat. 26. 26.</note> bread <hi>ſigillatim,</hi> but the cup he gave to the next, and he to the next; for, he ſaith, <hi>Luk 21. 17.

                           </gap>, the diſtributers do ſuffer or permit each perſon to take his part of the bread. There might be different Rites in ſeverall Churches as to this point, and of no great moment one way or other; but for all the Communicants ſitting down at the very Table by companies, and their ſitting and receiving the Elements, I finde not in my ſimple reading in Antiquity, when Communicants grew numerous, and met in one common place to perform Divine Offices: but ſo did Chriſt and all other Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall ſocieties, which eat in chambers and houſes, and as I ſhewed you before, were not under ten nor above twenty of a company.</p>
                        <p>Let then the Lords and his Diſciples ſitting at the ſame Table in that Rituall poſture and manner then in uſe be holden as indifferent or appendant to the Paſchall cuſtom; for we ſhall never hit that pattern in all reſpects, becauſe they ſate at the Table while Chriſt bleſſed and brake the Bread, which we that have ſeverall Tables full do not, nor can do; and let the Diſciples dividing among themſelves, or handing both the Bread and Cup from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56580:272"/> be accounted indifferent too, and hardly and not conveniently imitable in our numbers, yea and not certain neither (though very probable to me) for if one, as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> holds it ſo, yet another, as<note place="margin">Martyr. in <hi>1 Cor. 11. 24.</hi>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56580:274"/> Papiſts, who take the Bread into their mouths, and touch it not with hand, out of a too ſuperſtitious ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration<note place="margin">Beza Epiſt. 2.</note> of the Elements, as <hi>Beza</hi> notes: Nor do they of them that ſearch out the footſteps of this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom riſe any higher than about five or ſix hundred years ago.</p>
                        <p>The ſignification of it is, the appropriation of Chriſt to our ſelves, whom God makes ours by his gift, and we make ours by faith, even as truly as if he were put into our very hand.

                        <p>2. <hi>Eat ye, drink ye all of it:</hi> Chriſt ſpeaks and repeats often <hi>Joh. 6. the eating of his fleſh, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his blood,</hi> at which ſome of his followers took offence, conceiving him carnally and literally, which he told them were to be underſtood ſpiritually, <hi>ver.</hi> 63. There is a ſpirituall eating and drinking Chriſt his fleſh and blood by faith only, which is <hi>extra</hi>-ſymbolicall or without the Sacrament, for that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was delivered a year or two before this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was inſtituted; and it is ſuch, as without which <hi>ye have no life in you,</hi> ver. 53. which may not be ſaid of all that never received this Sacrament; but that ſpirituall eating and drinking is here ſymbolized, as that fleſh and blood is: For the underſtanding of which, let us neither be like the carnall <hi>Iſraelite</hi> that did eat Manna, and drink of the Rock, but neither ſaw nor taſted Chriſt in them; nor on the other ſide let us be like the <hi>Capernaites,</hi> Joh. 6. that had a groſs apprehenſion of eating very fleſh, and drinking mans blood, but rightly conceive the meaning thus:</p>
                        <p>1. The firſt and not the leaſt thing is this, that This is the one and only Ordinance under the Goſpel where eating and drinking are Sacred and Religious acts: for in all the world, among all ſorts of men, friendſhip, fellowſhip, communion, are maintained
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56580:275"/> and ſhown in feaſting together, eating and drinking together; and our God never let his Church be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch an Ordinance, wherein he and his people might teſtifie this fellowſhip and communion: In the Law there was not only a Lamb roſted, but in all their <hi>Shelamim</hi> or Peace-offerings, they that brought them had part to feaſt upon and make good cheer as at all their feaſts they rejoyced before the Lord, God bidding th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I will come in and ſup with him, and he with me:</hi> Thus God entertains his friends, invites them to eat and drink with him upon his own Sacrifices, upon Chriſt the great Sacrifice: It's Gods own cheer, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for ſuch <hi>Abrahams</hi> as are the friends of God: What a favour and condeſcenſion of God is this!

Nay, and further yet, It was a cuſtom in Covenants making that the Conſederates feaſted, eat and drank together; therefore <hi>Birith</hi> the Hebrew word Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, may come of <hi>Barah</hi> to eat, and ſo ſtill, and further it is implied that this is a Covenant ſolemnity, an eating and drinking of confederates together, God ſmels a ſavour of reſt in the Sacrifice of Chriſt, and we eat and drink of that fleſh and blood ſacrificed unto God, and renew our Covenant with him, and he with us, by mutuall feeling, he to be ours, we his. I am ſo taken up with this, that if no more be ſaid, I ſhould be ſatisfied, but there is more.</p>

                        <p>2. That Chriſt is full and perfect nouriſhment of the ſoul, both meat and drink; <hi>Joh. 6. 55. My fleſh is meat indeed, my blood is drink indeed,</hi> farre beyond Manna, which yet was called <hi>Angels food,</hi> as the ſubſtance is beyond the type: ſights may pleaſe the eye, ſounds or airs the ear, but they are not ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as nouriſhment unto life; life cannot be maintained without nouriſhment; growing bodies <gap reason="foreign">

As nothing ſo neceſſary, ſo neither ſo ſweet and pleaſant, ſights are pleaſing to the eye, and ſmels to the ſenſe, but nothing is ſo cloſe and delightfull as the meat and drink to the ſenſe of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting; Chriſt is ſweet to faith, as meat and drink to hunger: There is no content comparable to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Chriſt. He is Manna, the beſt Bread and Wine, the beſt drink. The fruition of the joys of heaven is ſet forth by the pleaſure of eating and drinking, <hi>Luk. 22. 30. That you may eat and drink at my Table in my Kingdome.</hi> It was experimentally ſaid of <hi>Galeacius</hi> that all the delights of this world are not comparable to an hours enjoyment of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                        <p>2. No act of ours could ſo well have ſignified the cloſe and intimate union of Chriſt with a Beleever: We may ſee at a diſtance, and hear and ſmell, but not taſte nor eat nor drink; the meat and drink is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56580:276"/> concorporated into us, and is made fleſh and bone with us, <hi>Job. 6. 56. He that eateth my fleſh and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my blood, dwels in me, and I in him:</hi> Chriſt muſt be preſent to the faith of a Chriſtian, for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eat and drink that which is abſent. This union with Chriſt is reall, though myſticall, and it is live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawn forth in this Ordinance, under the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of eating and drinking: We hardly conceive, and hardly beleeve it, but when we ſee the graft live, we are ſure it's knit; and we may be as ſure of our union with Chriſt, by his ſpirituall ſap of Grace which we finde is in us.</p>
                        <p>4. This command, <hi>Take and eat,</hi> goes before the pronouncing of the words, <hi>This is my Body; Aquinas</hi> ſaith it is a <hi>Hyſteron Proteron,</hi> but I ſhall not take his word, let's hear him ſpeak that was preſent, an ear witneſs, an eye witneſs <hi>Matth. 26. 26, 27. Take eat, This is my Body; Drink ye all of it, For this is my Blood:</hi> what ſtands this <hi>For</hi> for, if <hi>drink ye,</hi> did not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?

                           <hi>Hooker</hi> makes uſe of it thus, That Chriſt is not preſent in the Elements, but in the worthy receiver: The order of the words ſhews it, firſt <hi>eat and drink,</hi> then it follows, <hi>for this is my Body, and this is my Blood:</hi> an ingenious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation that cuts the hamſtrings of the Popiſh or corporall preſence in or under the outward ſignes, as if it were a knife ſet in the Text to cut that intricate knot, that makes ſuch a garboyle in the Text: when you take and eat by faith, then is the Body and Blood of Chriſt preſent to you, but not latent and hidden in the Bread or Cup: The union of Chriſt is not otherwiſe with the Bread then as the thing ſignified

Here is no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pomp or oſtentation, no ſtatelineſs to take the eye, for as gaudy attire becomes not mourning, ſo this Sacrament ſetting forth the paſſion and ſufferings, the death and bloudſhed of our Lord had not been ſutable to him in his loweſt eſtate and darkeſt eclipſe, if it ſhould have ſhined in outward luſtre.

The Temple, Utenſils and Service were rich and ſtately; Chriſt was prefigured in golden Types,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56580:278"/> 
                           <hi>But grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 1. 17. <hi>But we have a better Covenant, and better Promiſes,</hi> Heb. 8. 6. <hi>And if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remains exceeds in glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that was an outward, this an inward glory; that was in <hi>Moſes</hi> face, this in the face of Chriſt; that the carnal <hi>Jew</hi> might ſee, this the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Chriſtian ſeeth; <hi>We ſaw his glory,</hi> Joh. 1. 14. or rather there the glory was veiled, <hi>But we with open face behold the glory of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 13, 18. The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their Ordinance was a ſtumbling block to them, for they reſted in the cabinet, and looked not for the jewels; The meanneſſe of our Ordinances are a ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling block to us, for we look not for the <hi>treaſure in ſuch earthen veſſels.</hi> God doth great things by pooreſt meanes, <hi>Jericho</hi>'s wals fall at the ſound of Rams<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horns, the fiery ſting is healed by a piece of braſſe, the ſight reſtored to the blinde by the uſe of ſpittle and clay; The figure in this Sacrament is poor, the thing ſignified heavenly and rich; the Seal is mean, the inheritance or eſtate is great, but why were the types ſo rich, and our memorials ſo poor?

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56580:278"/> it is that the ſigne is called by the name of the thing ſignified, as the bread, Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the wine is called Chriſts bloud; The Rock was Chriſt, Circumciſion called the Covenant; The Lamb called the Paſſeover; and in common ſpeech, When we look on a Picture, we ſay, This is <hi>Caſar,</hi> this is <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> this is <hi>Hercules;</hi> nothing more ordinary. In the Sacrament this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude is a ſimilitude of proportionality (ſaith <hi>Bonaventure</hi>) conſiſting of four termes: You are moſt of you Arithmeticians, and you have a golden Rule, called, The Rule of Three, becauſe three terms being given, the fourth is given; and this ſets forth to you the Analogy of a Sacrament in four termes; As water in Baptiſme waſhes the body, ſo the Spirit by his grace, or the bloud of Chriſt cleanſeth the ſoul; As the bread and wine nouriſh and refreſh the body, ſo the body and bloud of Chriſt nouriſheth and refreſheth the ſoul: As by the hand we take, and with our mouth we eat and drink the bread and wine, ſo by faith we receive the body and bloud of Jeſus Chriſt; If you deſtroy the ſimilitude, you deſtroy the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Papiſts do by their Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for they deſtroy the Analogy: Thus the accidents of Bread and Wine, or the <hi>Species,</hi> doe not nouriſh the Body (ſay we;) Nor the very Body and Bloud of Chriſt doth not paſſe into bodily nouriſhment (ſay they) (for it was horrible to imagine it) therefore there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, the ſimilitude is deſtroyed, and ſo the Sacrament.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. The firſt extream is that which ſome did fear in <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and others at firſt, and yet is unjuſtly charged upon us by many, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, naked ſignes, empty figures and ſhadows, meerly repreſenting the death of Chriſt, as the Picture of <hi>Hercules</hi> reſembles and repreſents <hi>Hercules,</hi> which we diſclaim, and leave it to Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anizing ſpirits, and other Levellers of Divinity; for we are taught that Sacramentall ſignes are more than meer repreſenting ſignes, being Seals which do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and make over unto us the ſpirituall benefit which they repreſent and exhibit, alſo they are ſigns which God commands us to uſe, and in their right uſe he conferres upon us the benefit, as the Seal
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56580:288"/> paſſes a Right to the Eſtate promiſed and conveyed, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom. 4. 11. He received the ſign of circumciſion, a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith,</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 16. The cup of bleſsing which we bleſs, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt; The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> not repreſentation only, but communion or participation alſo; for the picture of a loaf of bread feeds not the hungry, nor doth the Ivy-buſh refreſh the weary, and therefore there is not only a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the body of Chriſt broken, by the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the bread, but <hi>Take and eat and drink,</hi> which denotes participation of the body and blood of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The other extream is twofold: 1. That the very body and blood of Chriſt is, as it were, moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up with the bread and wine, or hidden under them, which is the ſenſe of the Conſubſtantiatiſts or Lutheran Churches; and this, though it be too groſs an opinion, yet is not liable to ſo many mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and incompreſenſible abſurdities as the other, which is, 2. That the bread and wine ceaſe to be, and are evoided, being turned or change, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them into the very ſubſtance of the fleſh and blood of Chriſt, which is hidden under the <hi>ſpecies</hi> or outward accidents of bread and wine, a monſtrous Paradox, holden ſtifly by the Tranſubſtantiatiſts or Papiſts.</p>
                        <p>The middle way holden by the Churches of our Confeſſion, is, That the outward Elements do repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as Signes and exhibit as Seales and morall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to the faith of the receiver, the very Body and Blood of Chriſt ſacrificed, as ſpirituall repaſt
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56580:288"/> for our ſouls and ſpiritually given and taken, but that they continue not as incorporated with them, nor are converted into the very naturall Body of Chriſt, as locally or corporally, there to be received by the mouth of the receiver.</p>
                        <p>We hold a difference or change of bread and wine bleſſed, but it is a change of ſignification not of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, a relative change, not reall, a change in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of uſe and eſteem, not of their naturall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as the wax, now a Seal to a Conveyance is wax ſtill, but not a Seal, not of that value till now; all the Rhetoricall flowers uſed by the Ancients reach no further, if they do, we cannot keep them company: We hold that the Body and Blood of Chriſt is really, that is, truly exhibited and preſent to the faith of the receiver; and we might expreſs the reall preſence, as reall is oppoſed to imaginary or chimericall, were it not for caption and miſ-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; none of ours denies the Body of Chriſt to be really, though ſpiritually eaten by a Beleever; nay it is <hi>immotum axioma,</hi> whatſoever is eaten, in that it is<note place="margin">

                        </head>
                        <p>For atteſtation of this ſenſe, many Arguments may be muſtred up together.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Compare one part of this Sacrament with the other: <hi>This cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood,</hi> that is by Metonymy, the Seal of the New Teſtament, but not the New Teſtament it ſelf: ſo, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> that is the Signe and Seal of it, but not it ſelf.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Compare the one Sacrament of the Goſpel with the other: In Baptiſm the water is water with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reall alteration, ſo here the bread is bread, the wine is wine, not changed into fleſh or blood.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Compare the Sacraments of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the New: Circumciſion is the Covenant becauſe the Sign or Seal of it, the Lamb is the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver becauſe the memoriall or ſign of it, ſo the bread is my Body, the wine is my Blood in the ſame form of ſpeech.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Language in which our Saviour ſpake, had no other property of expreſſion, there being no word for [<hi>ſignifie</hi>] but [<hi>is</hi>] in ſtead thereof, as Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men ſay; and its certain the Scripture in both Teſtaments, Hebrew and Greek, uſes the ſame form in a hundred places, giving the name of the thing ſignified to the ſign, as hath been ſhown, as <hi>the ſeven ears of corn are ſeven years. The dry bones are the houſe of Iſrael. The ſeven Candleſticks are ſeven Churches,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> are not proper in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56580:289"/> the Lutheran ſenſe, no more than to ſay, This Cloak is <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> is in it: nor in the Popiſh ſenſe, except the Body of Chriſt be there before the words be pronounced, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> which ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be thus, Let this be my Body; as God ſaid, <hi>Let there be light,</hi> not This is light, for it was not light before.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The ſpirituall benefit which is eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſts Body and Blood by faith, is no leſs in our ſenſe, than if there were his very fleſh, for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The fleſh profits nothing,</hi> Joh. 6. and the Papiſts hold that the eating of Chriſts fleſh by wicked men profits nothing, except beſides the Sacramentall, there be a ſpirituall feeding upon Chriſt, which we affirm.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The Apoſtles underſtood theſe words as we do, and as the Hebrews had ever underſtood the ſame expreſſion for form in the Old Teſtament, elſe they would have been amazed and ſtartled at it, and have asked ſome queſtion as they were inquifitive enough in leſſer matters, but they ſaw Chriſt fit at table, and eat and drink firſt himſelf, and therefore could not be ignorant of their meaning.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. The Capernaite Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. having taken offence at thoſe frequent expreſſions of eating Chriſts fleſh and drinking his blood, underſtanding them carnally, were anſwered by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>The fleſh profits nothing, The words that I ſpeak are ſpirit and life,</hi> as if he himſelf would give the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. The Apoſtle thrice in this Chapter following cals it ſtill bread after conſecration, as alſo in the Chapter foregoing, and ſurely he that never before
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56580:290"/> did, would not delude the ſenſes of his Diſciples in this Ordinance; and himſelf cals it wine too, <hi>Matth. 26. 26. I will not henceforth drink of this fruit of the Vine,</hi> which is the Periphraſis uſuall among the Jews for wine.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. The remembrance of Chriſt, the <hi>ſhewing forth his death till he come,</hi> do import the abſence of his Body, which the Scripture tels us, aſcended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and there is contained, in lieu of his corporall abſence he ſent the Spirit to abide for ever as another Comforter: Memorials and monuments are of things abſent.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. For the Ancient Fathers they prove againſt the Marcionites, that held the Body of Chriſt to be meerly phantaſticall, That it is ſubſtantiall, becauſe the Elements of bread and wine are ſubſtantiall, which was no good argument, if only the accidents or ſhadows of the Elements do remain; and all along downwards they call the outward Elements, ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols,<note place="margin">

                        <p>II. To reject with utmoſt deteſtation the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and incomprehenſible Errour of Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and corporall preſence, by which Doctrine a ſilly Prieſt doth that which all the Angels cannot do, and that is, Make his Maker, as they call the Hoſt; and people do devour their God, and yet they juſtifie it by Gods omnipotency, that God is able to effect it, which is no better an argument than the Turks may juſtifie moſt of the fooleries of their Alcoran. There are two grounds for the rejection of this abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Idolatry and Sacriledge which doth enſue upon it, and that is the adoration and worſhip of the Hoſt, a piece of bread, and the mutilation or maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sacrament by bread only, and the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory Sacrifice of Chriſt himſelf in the Maſs, who was once only offered up to God upon the Croſs, all which are the iſſue of this Errour.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The monſters of contradiction and abſurdity to ſenſe and reaſon which follow thereupon. It was begotten by feigned miracles and fabulous Legends, and is the mother of blaſphemies and inextricable abſurdities, which ſet faith it ſelf on the rack, and which though they would ſeem eaſily to blow away, yet by their ſtragling it appears they ſtrive with that they cannot maſter. The point of Conſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath brought forth a grand abſurdity, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by ſome <hi>Pſeudo</hi>-Lutherans, the Ubiquity
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56580:291"/> of Chriſts Body in all places.</p>
                        <p>But this of Tranſubſtantiation ſurpaſſes all, as I ſhew thus,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Suppoſe Chriſt ſitting at the table with his Diſciples, and eating this bread and drinking this cup firſt, as the cuſtom at the Paſchall Supper was, and as the Papiſts generally, and the Fathers hold, and we deny not, becauſe the Scripture ſeems plain for it, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Matth. 26. 19. Henceforth I will not drink of the fruit of the Vine;</hi> ſuppoſing, I ſay, this, How is it poſſible or imaginable that he ſhould eat himſelf? or how can he ſit at table, and yet be in the mouths of his Apoſtles? Was he at the ſame time in his Apoſtles mouths or ſtomacks, while he ſate and roſe from table, and diſcourſed thoſe three Chapters of <hi>John</hi> 15, 16, 17? or while he ſweat that Bloody ſweat in his Agony in the Garden, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a monſtrous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility!</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It's Impoſſible to make that which was before exiſtent and in being: Can a father beget a ſon that<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Chelling.</hi> p. 70.</note> is already begotten? Can an Architect build a houſe that is already built? Can the body of Chriſt, which is before the converſion of the bread, be made or produced by the turning of bread into it? Can he that was conceived by the holy Ghoſt born of the Virgin be made by pronouncing of four or five words? If ever deluſions were ſtrong, theſe are, <hi>Nam factum facere &amp; factum infectum facere,</hi> are equally impoſſible.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. They ſay that the ſubſtance of bread and wine is avoided, and that only the accidents remain, ſo that there is length and nothing long, breadth and nothing broad, thickneſs and nothing thick, white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56580:291"/> and nothing white, moiſture and nothing moiſt, ſweetneſs and nothing ſweet, that is, a long, broad, thick, white, moiſt, ſweet Nothing. The Prieſt pours out nothing but lines and colours, when he pours out the wine, for theſe accidents of bread and wine are not in the bread, becauſe that is avoided and vaniſht, and they are not in the Body of Chriſt, as themſelves ſay, and yet it is plain this bread and wine do nouriſh the body, and is the body nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by meer accidents? Can there be plainer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions?</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Can the ſame body at the ſame time have his juſt dimenſions, diſtance of parts, ſymmetry, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, as the Body of Chriſt hath, and yet not have theſe, becauſe all parts? yea the whole Body of Chriſt, ſay they, are in one and the ſelf ſame point or crum of bread.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Can the Body of Chriſt which is much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be wholly contained in a wafer or piece of bread, in his full dimenſions, and that as many times as there are points, crums, drops in the bread or wine?</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Can the bread be turned into the very Body of Chriſt, and yet not anything of that bread become anything of Chriſt, nor the matter nor form nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of bread be made either the matter or form or accidents of Chriſt?</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Can the ſame thing, as Chriſts true Body, at the ſame time be wholly above it ſelf, and wholly below it ſelf, within and without it ſelf? can it be moved, and yet be ſtill? be carried from one place to another, and yet not move? be brought from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to earth, and yet not come out of heaven? who
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56580:292"/> then can aſſure me that when he hung upon the Croſs, he was not walking ſomewhere elſe, crucified and not crucified, eaten and not eaten, alive in one, dead in another place, as in caſe the Apoſtles ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated this Supper while Chriſt was in the grave.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. What diſhonour do theſe men render the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt obnoxious unto, to be eaten by wicked men, by bruit creatures, by mice, by other vermin, to be caſt into ſome unclean place? for ſo long as the form of bread remains, ſo long the Body of Chriſt is there, though it be in the mouth or belly of a mouſe, ſaith <hi>Ales</hi> and the reſt of the Schoolmen, who do one where or other acknowledge the moſt of theſe monſtrous abſurdities, and go about to heal and ſalve them. I ſurceaſe from raking further into this ingratefull ſink, whoſe name Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is but of yeſterday in compariſon, and which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honours the Body of Chriſt into a monſter, deſtroies the nature of the Sacrament, and fils the world with dreadfull contentions and broils; and let us but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, 1. What grievous impoſitions the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts lay upon the faith of them that are devoted to her communion. 2. What contradictions and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities the common people do ignorantly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly beleeve. 3. What ſtrong deluſions even to believe lies God gives up Learned men unto, that refuſe the ſimplicity of the truth for intereſts and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick ends! 4. What a mercy of God it is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from that tyranny, which leaves us no other choice, but to ſwallow and digeſt ſuch impoſſible things, or to be ſacrificed in flames; and the Lord forbid the re-entrance of that Religion among us,

Having paſt the moſt rugged and craggy part of my way, now we ſhall have a ſweeter and ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; and the third thing that I commend to you is, To keep fixt your eyes and hearts upon the inward of this Sacrament, which Chriſt himſelf doth anatomize and unfold to you, ſaying, <hi>This is my Body, This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood,</hi> teaching all Miniſters to explain the outward Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance what it means, and all communicants to ſet their hearts upon it; for as the Parchment and Wax are little worth, but the Eſtate conveyed, ſo the Bread and Wine do but convey by their uſe, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood of Chriſt, and the Covenant of grace and peace confirmed unto us; and as we uſe to ſearch and pick out of every corner of the ſhell that's bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as of a Wallnut, the kernell that is in it, ſo we ſhould ſtudy the marrow and kernell of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to loſe the ſight and uſe of nothing here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; God loſes honour and praiſe, and we bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and com ort, when we look not to the inwards of an outward Ordinance, eſpecially when Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and all the great and capitall benefits that accrue by him, are not only repreſented but confirmed, and to be participated: They that look upon a meer repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of Chriſts death in this Ordinance, reduce it to a pretence or ſhadow, and look for too little, for it's a ſeali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Word anſwers that queſtion by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of qualification of the perſon, a Believer: The Spirit anſwers it by witneſſing and ſealing it up to our ſpirits that we are children: The graces of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation do anſwer it, as fruit doth to the life of the tree, by demonſtration: This Sacrament anſwers it by exhibition and offering Chriſt to me that I may appropriate him, for the blood was <hi>ſhed for you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 20. for you that take and eat and drink.</p>

                        <p>SO much be ſpoken upon the outward part or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper, the Elements and Rites: <hi>He took bread, and giving thanks he brake it, and gave it: Likewiſe alſo the cup after Supper.</hi> And ſo much alſo touching the Kernell and Marrow of the Feaſt; <hi>This is my Body broken for you: This Cup is the New Teſtament in my blood.</hi> And now having paſt through our thorny and perplexed way, encombred with adverſaries, through whom we muſt fight our way, we are come into a fairer and clearer road, as into a champain, not ſo much infeſted with enemies and Diſputes: For whether it be that a practicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be eaſilier ſatisfied than a ſubtill wit, or that the devil doth moſt labour to corrupt our intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, that ſo as once he may corrupt our worſhip and our morals, or whatſoever the reaſon be, there are
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56580:294"/> more wranglings and Diſputes raiſed about ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and theoreticall Points, than about matters of practice or morall obedience.</p>
                        <p>Theſe words contain our Saviour his mandate or charge for the celebration of this Ordinance, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the end whereunto it ſerves: <hi>This do in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me: This do as oft as ye drink it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me.

None of the Evangeliſts have theſe words but <hi>Luke</hi> only, out of whom either our Apoſtle takes the words, or at leaſt ſymbolizeth with him, making them or rendring them as part of Chriſts own words ſpoken by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the firſt Inſtitution and C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>When I ſay it is a command given to the Church, or to the Saints, I mean, that it is an inner command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an inner Ordinance, (as there was inner Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances in the Temple) for Church-members and Diſciples. The command of hearing the Word is given to all. The commandment of being baptized is to believers, as a Sacrament of their initiation or entrance, or admiſſion. To make a Diſciple, and to baptize one, ſeems to be put for the ſame, <hi>John</hi> 4. 1, 2. but this commandment, <hi>Do this,</hi> lies more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner yet, it appertains to them that are Diſciples alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or Church-members, which was ſignified in the ancient Chriſtian Churches by the baptiſtery or font at the Church-door, and by the Table <hi>intra Cancellos</hi> within the Chancel; ſo in the Paſſeover, a

This then is that peculiar and moſt inward command and priviledge that appertains to an incloſed company, it is a paſture incloſed, not a common; Here Chriſt holds a more familiar preſence and fellowſhip with his peculiar people, to whom he vouchſafes an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour admiſſion; Shall not we then keep this charge, and obſerve this commandment, and enjoy this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge properly belonging to Diſciples? Oh it was this that made Chriſtians of old, when they were for their ſinne debarred and excluded, ſo cry, weep, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their ſad caſe, that they ſhould depart as it were from the preſence of their Lord, and ſtand aloof in the court that had been admitted into the parlour or chamber of preſence; and for thoſe that were in the ſchool of catechiſm, called <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>If we look upon the reaſon or occaſions of that great eclypſe which hath befallen this Ordinance for ſo long a time, and in ſo many places of this Land, we might be long upon ſo unpleaſing a ſubject, but I ſhall but touch, and ſo away.</p>

I acknowledge that when he brings a man, or a Church into an incapacity of Sacraments, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſſe, or as in that caſe then, that a man was unclean by reaſon of a dead, body, or in a journey far off, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 10. and ſuch, like caſes now; There is a relaxation of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for the time, and either neceſſity or, duty may diſpence with our forbearance; And I further ſay, That God is juſt in puniſhing us with this loſſe or ſtroke for our abuſe and contempt of this holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance in former times, by ſhutting out thoſe that were fit to be admitted, meerly upon a ceremonious inconformity, and compelling in upon penalty, that by this teſt they might finde out Recuſant Papiſts, ſuch as were contrary to their own rules, ſottiſhly ignorant, notoriouſly wicked; and therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this ſtorm may be upon us, and this breach in this Ordinance; for the Lord tels <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that when in good intention they ſought to bring up the Ark of God, and laid it on a Cart, which ſhould have been carried on the ſhoulders of the Levites, he made a breach upon them, for that they ſought him not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the due order, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 13.

                        <p n="2">2. As for them of the Separation, whoſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage it was, and of ſome of them the deſign to have us
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56580:301"/> broken, that they might thrive as the people on the Sea-coaſt do by the wrack; They (I ſay) while ſome were labouring, and all were waiting for to have Gods order ſtamped by civil Authority, not to give eſteem or value to that which is of God, but to make it more currant with us; As the ſtamp makes not the gold more precious, but more currant in common uſe; While I ſay ſome were endeavouring this, or haply ſome of you will ſay, <hi>While men ſlept the envious man ſowed his tares,</hi> and took his opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of that long vacation, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did of <hi>Moſes</hi> his abſence in the Mount, and they planted their bat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tery here upon this Sacrament, and cried down pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous Communions with all their might, laying a good foundation, That onely viſible Saints are fit Communicants, which is true as to the Churches Admiſſion; That real Saints only are worthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, which is true too, as to the inward grace or benefit, but then, as alwayes in ſuch caſes it is the ſuperſtructure was hay and ſtubble; That Saints are only ſuch as are of their making and judging; And, That they that are of their opinion or party, though vicious in life and empty of true grace, are Saints; and thence come the ſeveral Communions and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions moulded up together into ſeveral bodies, for and by intereſts, paſſions and worldly ends, which I ſpeak not of all, for ſome godly ſouls might be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away to enjoy this Sacrament in a Communion more pleaſing to them, as <hi>Aaron</hi> was in the buſineſſe of the golden Calf, and others were mightily taken with it, who hardly paſſing for honeſt men at home in their own Churches, were preſently canonized <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="3">3. When I look upon the ſtanding Miniſters, who ſhould diſpenſe the Sacrament, I muſt plead this for them, that while it is their intention and practiſe to make the door of this Sacrament no wider, no nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower than Chriſt hath made it, they cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. It may be ſo wide, as to let in the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed to the Paſſeover, and bring Greeks into the Temple, as they ſaid of <hi>Paul.</hi> It may be ſo narrow, as to ſhut out fit and worthy Communicants for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, for meer ceremonies, as in former times; There is great difference between Chriſts real members and gueſts at this Table, and as I may ſay the viſible Churches members or gueſts; If he be a viſible Profeſſour of faith unſhipwrackt, of capacity to diſcern the Lords body, of life without ſcandal, he is a gueſt of the Church, and yet not haply a true member of Chriſt, but a Jew outwardly in letter, a <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> a <hi>Judas,</hi> an hypocrite; We are not <hi>Domini,</hi> but <hi>Diſpenſatores,</hi> Lords of the Sacrament we are not, Stewards we may be, but the Steward cannot invite to his Maſters Table, whom the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter will not have his gueſt, nor ſhut out any whom the Maſter hath invited; The Prieſts that were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in the Law, did God make baſe and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before the people, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 9. and their partiality was in admitting the blinde, lame and blemiſht Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the rich, or of their friends: Such partiality will embaſe the Miniſters of Chriſt, and the Lord taxes the Propheteſſes for like partiality, <hi>Ezek. 13. 19. For handfuls of barley, and pieces of bread, they ſlay the ſouls that ſhould not die; they ſave the ſouls alive that ſhould not live;</hi> Theſe are the two extreams,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56580:302"/> which as applied to our purpoſe is to ſhut the door a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them that ſhould come in, and open the door to them that ſhould not enter, which if any do for handfuls of barley <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for partial reſpects and carnal ends, their ſin is great.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. If we look on the generality of people in this Land, they are not prepared, and which is worſe, they will not be. How many are bruits for their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and beaſts for their lives? The onely way to bring them and the Sacrament together, is either to ſtoop the Ordinance to them, and being ſo ſet on tilt, I fear it will runne dregs, or to elevate and lift them up to the Ordinance, and that's the only way to be attempted; God grant ſucceſſe. When the ignorant, ſuperſtitious, prophane are weeded out, the Garden will hardly look green; Theſe are they that hold up old corruptions; Religion is nothing with them but an ancient cuſtome, or tradition received from father to ſon, <hi>The high-places were not taken away, for as yet the people had not prepared their heart to the God of their Fathers,</hi> 2.

For the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe of thoſe places where ſecurity, ſenſleſneſſe of ſpiritual things, oppoſition, is predominant, this Rule would be laid, That there is no reaſon to deny thoſe that are godly the liberty of performance of this duty, or enjoyment of this benefit; Why are they ſtarved, becauſe others will not, or ought not to eat?

He that will be of our body, muſt ſubmit to the Laws and Rules of that Corporation he is free of, whether to be enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed or disfranchiſed: What if wicked men break in and abuſe our Sacrament? what if Heathens had ſo done in the Primitive Church? If they eat our bread, it's no Sacrament to them.

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>4</label> Here we learn how to exerciſe our mindes and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations in the celebration of this Supper, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>remembrance of Chriſt,</hi> the ſurvey of whom is inriched with excellent fruit of renewing our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, quickning our faith elevating our affections; and the impreſſion made upon us by this lively ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle of a dying Saviour, cannot but work as the bloody Robes of <hi>Caeſar</hi> did upon the people, when they were hanged out in ſight by <hi>Marc. Anthony;</hi> and therefore it is ſuitable to the end of this Sacrament, to be exerciſing our memories, mindes and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the peruſall of Chriſt Jeſus. I know that ſome Churches uſe to ſing a Pſalm, while the action is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, whom I condemn not, as a means to keep the heart intent, and in ſpirituall frame or fixedneſs, but ſhould rather chuſe a ſilent meditation and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the minde in the remembrance of Chriſt, for that's more ſuitable to the end of this Ordinance, and to Chriſts example and inſtitution, who according to the cuſtom of the Jews filled the time of action with commemoration, and cloſed it with a Hymn: and if we may give credit to the Jewiſh Writers, and others out of them, as <hi>Hugo Broughton</hi> ſhews in his Commentaries on <hi>Daniel,</hi> the Pſalms of the Hallel or Hymn ſung by the Jews, was the 113, 114, and ſo onward; and it's very probable that Chriſt and the Apoſtles did not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vary, for they ſung a Hymn at the cloſe, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 30. which example I need not ſtand
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56580:304"/> to improve againſt the Anti-pſalmiſts of this age.</p>
                        <p>There are ſeverall pertinent meditations that may fully take up the time of the action with great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and benefit to our ſouls, as namely,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The dreadfulneſs of Gods juſtice which with a terrible ſtroak did ſmite the great Shepherd for our ſins, the leaſt dram of it would have ſunk us to all eternity.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The curſed nature of ſinne that ſo exaſperates the holy God, and makes ſuch a breach between God and the creature, as can never be made up but by the broken body of the Lord of Glory.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. What it coſt to redeem a ſoul, a maſs of gold as big as the whole earth, not valuable with one drop of this blood.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. What an infinite love broke forth, that God, rather than let our ſouls be loſt, would ſend his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Son, and make him ſin for us.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. What a great work it is to reconcile a ſinner to his God, all names of men and Angels are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it, all their ſufferings would not pay a penny of this debt, which is not diſſolved by any blood but of the Lord of Glory.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. That God would not only pardon ſin, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forth a generall pardon, as a King pardons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels; but ſo pardon, as might even melt the hardeſt heart, and for ever humble, and ſilence, and ſatisfie it by the love of God, and the ſufficiency of that Sacrifice, whoſe vertue extends to thouſands, and laſts alwaies.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. That the gratious Covenant of God made with all that beleeeve in Chriſt, is ſealed and ratified with
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56580:305"/> ſuch blood, as there needs no doubt of the validity of the Covenant, though one man bad as many ſins on him as all the world.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. That Gods way of ſaving man by a Mediatour, the death of a Mediatour, doth oblige man to be the than krulleſt creature in the world: Angels that ſin'd not, have need of no Mediatour; Angels that ſin'd have none; man that ſin'd, and therefore needs one, hath one given to him, <hi>The man Christ Jeſus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">9. That as God gave Chriſt for you, ſo he gives him to you, that he that was your Sacrifice offered up to God, might in this Sacrament be offered unto you, as meat and drink, as ſpirituall repaſt, that as we live by Chriſt, ſo we may live upon him, being entertained as confederates to feaſt with God upon the Sacrifice offered up unto him. It is a fruitfull field of Meditation, through which ye may walk the time of celebration, and then breathe out your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations in a Song of praiſe, as the cloſe and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick of this heavenly Feaſt: Concerning which Hymn, wherewith the Jews did uſually cloſe the <hi>coenam apolyticam,</hi> or dimiſſory Supper, calling it the <hi>Hallel,</hi> from the firſt word of it <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> you may conſult not only the Jewiſh Writers, but our Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, <hi>Cameron Myroth in</hi> Matth. 16. 30. <hi>Druſius in</hi> Matth. 26. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>VVHen this Ordinance of the Supper is ſuitable to the Inſtitution, and the Communicant is ſuitable to the Ordinance, then all is right. Of the former I have acquitted my ſelf, by ſetting forth the nature, uſe, end of this Sacrament, according to our Lords Inſtitution, recited by the Evangeliſts, and by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Paul</hi> in this place.</p>

                        <p>Now I am to proceed unto the later, which is to render the Communicant ſuitable to the Ordinance, of which our Saviour did not in the Inſtitution di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56580:306"/> ſpeak, but the Apoſtle in this place ſpeaks more fully and directly unto, than in any other place is found, the abuſes and diſtempers of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> leading him moſt properly to it; and though in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Churches the grand errour and abuſe lies in the unſutableneſs of their Maſs to the Inſtitution, yet in Reformed Churches, who endeavour to imitate the pattern in the Mount, the common ſin lies in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutableneſs of the Communicant to the Ordinance; and ſo the point of worſhip ſtands between us; and the Papiſts, much alike as it ſtood between the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans and the Jews of old, The Samaritans uſed a falſe worſhip, <hi>Ye worſhip ye know not what,</hi> Joh. 4. 22. The Jews had a true worſhip, but were carnall, and for the moſt part formall worſhippers. The Feaſt is prepared, dreſt, and ordered according to the Inſtitution of Chriſt: Now the gueſts are to be ſurveyed and tried, whether they come worthily or unworthily, by the teſt or ticket of the Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine following to the end of the Chapter; of which I ſhall ſay this in generall.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That the Apoſtles Doctrine in this place is properly calculated for the rectifying the abuſes and unworthineſs of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as ye may ſee at the 33, 34, verſes, but ſo alſo moſt other Scriptures oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally written, are of generall uſe, their latitude is greater than their particular direction.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the Apoſtle ſpends the moſt of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine upon eating and drinking unworthily, ſetting home the ſin and danger of it, for, the occaſion, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſinne of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> required it; and yet doubtleſs the point of worthineſs, ſhould in order of nature be firſt ſtated, before unworthineſs can
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56580:306"/> be underſtood, for how ſhould I know ſinne, except firſt I knew a law of duty; how a crooked line, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I know what is ſtraight: and therefore to attent conſideration, the Apoſtle will be found to begin there, as I ſhall ſhew you afterwards.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That the Apoſtle in ſetting home the ſinne and danger of eating and drinking unworthily, ſpeaks thunder and lightning in very pertinent, but yet new and unuſuall phraſes, which are <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Theſe of the 26 verſe are the words of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                           <hi>Paul,</hi> who having recited what Chriſt did and ſaid at the firſt celebration and inſtitution of this Sacrament, goes about to ſet his <hi>Corinthian</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants to right, teaching them and us, what is the meaning of this Ordinance, and what the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, or main buſineſs of a communicant is, that ſo he may eat and drink worthily, <hi>viz. To ſhew forth the Lords death;</hi> this he collects from the inſtitution, this he inculcates upon the communicant, as the great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he is to do, that he may be ſuitable to the Ordinance.</p>
                        <p>The words have no difficulty, but what may beſt be opened in every point as it comes to hand: The firſt Point ſhall be from the connexion or whole words:</p>

                           <hi>People have need to be taught what the meaning of this Ordinance is, and what is the main buſineſs of the Communicant.</hi> The Apoſtle hath ſet forth this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and now teaches them what is the meaning or great buſineſs intended in it. <hi>For as often as,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56580:307"/> Outward Ordinances conſiſting of viſible matter, as moſt of the Jewiſh Ordinances did, and our Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do, do ordinarily terminate and bound the eye of the ignorant, that cannot, and of the Chriſtian outwardly, that doth not look within the rinde or ſhell of them: The time is not loſt that's beſtowed either by us in the anatomy and opening, or by you in learning and ſpelling out the minde and meaning of an Ordinance of God. <hi>When your children,</hi> Exod. 12. 26. <hi>ſhall ſay unto you, What mean you by this ſervice? ye ſhall ſay, It is the ſacrifice of the Lords Paſſeover,</hi> &amp;c. And in another inſtance, <hi>When your children ſhall ſay, What mean you by theſe ſtones? ye ſhall anſwer,</hi> Joſh. 4. 6. <hi>The waters of Jordan were cut off,</hi> &amp;c. This was the veil that covered the eye of the Jews, they had Sacrifices, Waſhings, manifold Rites, but were not able to ſpell and put together, they generally little dreamd of the meaning of them, but were as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle cals them, <hi>Jews outwardly and in the letter;</hi> for it pleaſed God in the times of that diſpenſation, to give his people the kernell, but incloſed in a hard ſhell; to give them a pillar of fire, but in a cloud; to hide the light in a dark lanthorne, to convey the truth in ſhadows. Now that the obſcurity is taken off the Ordinances, there remains an ignorance upon our hearts, and many of us know as little the meaning of our Sacraments, as the Jews did of theirs; there is ſcarce any of our ignorant, ſuperſtitious, prophane perſons, but they think there is ſome holineſs in this Sacrament, and therefore they put on a poſture of ſome reverence for the time, but the particular uſe of it, or the ſpirituall importance they know not, and therefore reſt in the <hi>opus operatum,</hi> and receive
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56580:307"/> the Sacrament as a medicinall potion naturally work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or worſhip that which ſhould be made uſe of by faith, for the nouriſhment of the ſoul.</p>

                        <p>The Uſe of this point may be for Inſtruction of both Miniſter and people.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, The Miniſter is hereby taught, That it is not only his duty to give the Sacrament, but alſo to teach the Sacrament; he gives the outward Elements, he teaches the inward meaning of them; he gives the bone, and ſhews the marrow that is in it; otherwiſe you take the Sacrament by rote, and he gives you <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegram nucem,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, a whoſe nut, to a child that cannot crack it, and ſo partakes in that ſin and guilt being dumb, which you contract being blinde. Our Saviour when he gave the Bread and the Cup, ſaid alſo, <hi>This is my Body, This Cup is the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in my Blood,</hi> and ſo taught the meaning. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> when he had recited the Inſtitution, ſhews the mind of it, <hi>As oft as ye eat, ye ſhew the Lords death.</hi> And you are to be taught what is Gods meaning, and what is the meaning of your own actions; Gods meaning is to make a repreſentation of Chriſts death and ſufferings, by the breaking of the bread, and to afford you the communion of his Body and Blood, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. The meaning of your actions is to make commemoration of Chriſt, and to ſhew forth his death: Gods meaning is to dreſs out Chriſt in beſt manner and fitteſt for a ſinner, Chriſt broken, Chriſt bleeding; and the meaning of your eating and drinking, is to feed ſorrowfully and ſweetly upon Chriſt, ſo prepared and preſented to you, for your repaſt and comfort. But now, if the ſame cup taken with ſuch ingredients, would be deadly poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56580:308"/> with ſuch a lively Cordiall, would you not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the Phyſician ſhould teach you to make it Cordiall, ſo the Lords Supper worthily received, is the moſt ſoveraign Cordiall: But ſome again may eat and drink damnation to themſelves, Would you not expect that the Miniſter, if he have either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of his duty, or reſpect to your ſouls, ſhould teach you to avoid the danger and obtain the benefit? If you do not, yet God looks for it at our hands, <hi>Ezek. 44. 23. And they</hi> (the Prieſts) <hi>ſhall teach my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the difference between the holy and prophane, and cauſe men to diſcern between the unclean and clean;</hi> for elſe you may eat and drink damnation to us, as well as to your ſelves.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div n="4" type="section">
                        <head>§. 4.</head>
                        <p>Secondly, The people are taught, To know the meaning of the Sacrament, before they take it: That's a terrible expreſſion, <hi>ver. 29. He eats and drinks damnation to himſelf not diſcerning the Lords Body,</hi> that is, not knowing the meaning, the nature, uſe and end of the Ordinance, which to underſtand is a good part of preparation, and without it, there can be no right or true preparation. And therefore all you that intend to be Supper-communicants, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend: The firſt leſſon which you muſt learn, the firſt queſtion to be anſwered is, What is the true meaning of this Ordinance? what is the main bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of it? for it is ſuppoſed in thoſe words, <hi>Exod. 12. 26. When your children ſhall ſay to you, What mean you by this ſervice, (i.</hi> Paſſeover,) that the father ſhould be able to teach his childe, as it is there di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and that the child ſhould, as his firſt leſſon be taught what is meant, To know what the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Ordinance is.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="165" facs="tcp:56580:308"/>1. It is a proper and excellent antidote or remedy of ſuch abuſes and miſcarriages as creep in at the door, either of ignorance, ſuperſtition, or prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and the Apoſtle ſignifies ſo much here, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying this corrective to thoſe diſtempers which then reigned in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> as if he had ſaid, Could you come and eat and drink ſo rudely, proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, confuſedly, irreverently, unworthily, if ye did conſider but what ye ought to do? that is, exerciſe communion with Chriſt, keep a commemoration of him, ſhew forth his death.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. This will direct all your preparations to the true end, your praiers, meditations, ſelf-examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will be anſwerable and ſuitable to the Ordinance. Here is not the eating of a piece of bread, nor the drinking of a cup of wine in a publique company of ſober men and of my betters (which yet is enough to the putting on my better clothes, and framing my ſelf to a grave compoſure) but here I am to meet my Lord Chriſt, and to receive him as my Saviour, I am to have the Covenant of mercy ſealed to me in his blood; I am to make a thankfull memoriall of Chriſt, and to profeſs my embracement and adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his death, as my only comfort; therefore be thou awakened, O my faith, my godly ſorrow, my ſpirituall appetite, my thankfulneſs, that I may go out to Chriſt, and he come in to me.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. This takes off all ſlighting and undervaluing of this Ordinance, which appears to an outward and carnall eye, No better bread or wine than I can have at home, for in this plain caſe is a rich Jewel, this bread is the body, this wine is the Blood of the Lord of Glory; and therefore I muſt not value the ſeal by
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56580:309"/> the worth of the wax, which is not worth a penny, but by the pardon, or the inheritance, which paſſes, and is conveyed by it.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. This keeps me from running blindfold into the ſin of guiltineſs of the Body and Blood of the Lord, and ſo into condemnation, for as the ſame Signet or Seal of a Prince, doth to one ſeal a pardon, to another an execution; ſo this very Sacrament is to a Beleever a ſeal of pardon, to another, as it were, the ſeal of his condemnation.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Laſtly, The preparation ſo much ſpoken of, and the ſelf-examination required by the Apoſtle, cannot be imagined to referre to the eating of bread and drinking wine, but to the inward thing of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: it neceſſarily follows that thoſe inward graces that enable us to have communion with Chriſt, and make commemoration of him, can never be known or ſought, except we know the meaning of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, for it is that which gives the Law and Rule of all our preparations. And ſo I have ſhown you the reaſons why we ſhould labour to underſtand the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of this Ordinance.</p>
                        <p>So much of this generall Point, the ſecond Point ſhall be taken from thoſe words, <hi>Ye ſhew the Lords death,</hi> or <hi>ſhew ye,</hi> for the word might be conſtrued imparatively, but that the particle [<hi>For</hi>] would not then ſo well conſiſt.</p>

                        <p>Firſt, It is the Lords death which in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is ſhewn forth: The two ſtanding Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Jewiſh Church, Circumciſion and the Paſſeover, did both appear in blood. The two ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacraments of the Goſpel, do alſo referre to death, <hi>We are buried with him by Baptiſm, into death, Rom.</hi> 6. 4. and in the Supper, <hi>we ſhew the Lords death.</hi> As of all deliverances and benefits vouchſafed to <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, God would have the Paſſeover-delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance celebrated by a conſtant memoriall in all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; ſo of all that Chriſt doth for us, it is his death that muſt be ſhewn forth in all generations of the Church, till he come again: and therefore this Ordinance is <hi>ſpeculum crucifixi,</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith; and<note place="margin">

This death hath no ſecond in all the world, for it was the death of the Sonne of God, the death of the Lamb of God.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb n="168" facs="tcp:56580:310"/>1. Of the Sonne of God, the Lord of Glory, whoſe highneſs and excellency gave price and value to his death. Had he not been man he could not have ſuffered: Had he not been the Sonne of God, God bleſſed for ever, he could not have ſatisfied and conquered.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Of the Lamb of God, and therefore his death was a Sacrifice, and that's more than a Martyrdom; for though a Martyr may be ſaid to ſeal with his blood that truth he dies upon, yet no blood can ſeal the Covenant but this of Chriſt, no death can ratifie the Teſtament but the Teſtators death: Had the death been the death of the Lord, a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent perſon, and not alſo the death of a Lamb for Sacrifice, to make attonement, it had wanted one of his properties, but it was both. As it was the death of the Lord of Glory, the Sonne of God, ſo it gave us the moſt illuſtrious teſtimony and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the love of God, as ever was or could be, and that the Scripture often points unto. As it was the death of the Lamb of God, ſo it was a Sacrifice death, wherein he was made ſinne for us, and bore our ſinnes in his Body. As it was the<note place="margin">Joh. 11. 13. Rom. 5. Gal. 2. 20.</note> death both of the Sonne of God, and the Lamb of God, ſo it reconciled us ſinners unto God, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoriouſly redeemed and ranſomed us from our bondage to the curſe and wrath of God, the only ground and foundation of our hope, peace and comfort.</p>

                        <p>Secondly, It is the buſineſs of the Communicant to ſhew forth this death of the Lord: The Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it ſelf is full of death, what other language doth bread broken, and the blood ſevered from the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:56580:310"/> body, ſpeak but a dying Chriſt: As the Ordinance, ſo the Communicant doth by eating and drinking, in fact declare and annunciate his profeſſion of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to, and embracement of the death of Chriſt, we ſolemnly and publiquely avow, both to God and men, that we ſtick unto, and abide by the death of the Lord, for remiſſion of ſinne, and reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of our perſons to God; and it is a ſolemn part of Gods poſitive worſhip, to ſhew forth the death of Chriſt our Lord, not by a meer hiſtoricall relation, but a practicall and publique profeſſion of our faith, and acceptance thereof, which though at all times we may remember, yet God would have a ſolemn Ordinance in his Goſpel-Churches, for the commemoration and ſhewing of it forth, which Ordinance is this of the Supper. I know men are witty to elude Ordinances, and to flatter themſelves with private devotions and meditations, but when God hath ſet up an Ordinance on purpoſe, for the publique and ſolemn ſhewing of the Lords death; let them conſider it, that are not only careleſs of the benefit of it, but fail of their duty, by not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves at this ſolemn ſhewing of the Lords death: but how can it be expected that they that ſhew not the life of Chriſt by a godly converſation, ſhould care to ſhew forth his death by publique pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; or rather, how can it be conſtrued that they do it out of conſcience of duty, and not out of meer ſuperſtition, expecting that from the Sacrament, which the Papiſt expects from his auricular confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, to quit the old ſcore, that he may more freely begin upon a new.</p>
                        <p>But I may not forget that which is very learnedly

                     <p>The Sacrifice of Chriſt, or the offering of him up, was but once, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 26.

                        <p>We uſe to denominate the Communicant <hi>worthy</hi> or <hi>unworthy,</hi> not at all intending any merit or merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious condignity, for ſuch a worthineſſe is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt unworthineſſe, but a meetneſſe and congruity of the action to the rule of the action, and therefore the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56580:316"/> Apoſtle applies <hi>worthineſſe</hi> or <hi>unworthineſſe</hi> to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of communicating, <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily.</hi> In all Ordinances, either preaching, prayer, Sacraments, the eye of God is much upon the manner, how they are performed, which I might make my firſt point, but that I will not ſhoot my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row at ſo great a compaſſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Worthineſs</hi> is relative, and refers to the rule of the action, which here is the inſtitution, the Nature, Uſe and End of this Sacrament: for to eat and drink worthily, is to do it anſwerably and ſuitably to the Ordinance, when the Communicant hath, and ſo exerciſes ſuch graces, qualifications and deportment, inward and outward, as this Sacrament doth require, beſpeak and call for; And the contrary is unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when the manner of communicating, or the Communicant is not ſuitable or anſwerable to the Ordinance, either becauſe he hath not, or exerciſeth not the qualifications, that the Sacrament requires in a worthy receiver, or brings a contrary diſpoſition to it, and this interpretation is eaſie, natural and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing; for the Apoſtle layes down the inſtitution firſt, and then infers what receiving unworthily is, as a ſtrait Rule diſcovers a crooked line by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliance of it to the Rule; and thus the Scripture, which advances not the merit, but the meetneſſe of actions and perſons, uſeth to ſpeak, as <hi>Epheſ. 4. 1.

                        <p>I anſwer, the Apoſtle inſiſts upon the unworthy receiving, becauſe that was the caſe before him, but he did not forget himſelf, as if he had not ſhown what it is to receive worthily; for though he name not the word, but as implied in the word unworthily, yet he had enough declared the thing by his laying down the Inſtitution of this Sacrament, which is the rule of worthineſſe. It being nothing elſe but the anſwerableneſſe of the Communicant to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which every man that once knows the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance muſt alſo know, if he apply the rule and his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction together, and ſo I am confident you have the meaning of worthily and unworthily.</p>

                        <p>Seventhly, The Church it ſelfe doth not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily caſt out a meritorious ſinner without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Admonition, and hearty ſeeking of a loſt Sheep; for there are few that would cut off an unſound Leg or Arme, before they had tried all wayes; And our Saviour ſaith, <hi>If he neglect to hear the Church,</hi> (Matth. 18. 17.) as implying,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56580:334"/> That the Church deals with him by Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and entreaties, ſuch as may overcome his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, rather then puniſh it, and had rather heal him than cut him off. And ſo in the firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Poſition, I fortified the Sacrament againſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Intruſion: And in this ſecond I have forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Right of the Communicant againſt unjuſt invaſion.</p>
                        <p>And having ſhewed you the truth of this Point in two generall Poſitions; The firſt was, That this Ordinance is barred, and lies not open to all that may intrude. The ſecond was, That the right of a viſible Church-member is hedged in, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be hand over head invaded, and taken away from him. Now I ſhall ſhortly ſhew you what Uſe may be made of all this.</p>

                        <p>THat the truth lies between theſe two. I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a forcible Entry, or violent Intruſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Ordinance, and an unjuſt invaſion of the Communicants right; For both the Ordinance it ſelf, and right of the Communicant are hedged in; As in all Corporations, whoſoever will, may not intrude into the freedom, nor yet the rights belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that freedom be taken away, but in an orderly way.

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56580:335"/> that God gives you a nearer and more inward admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto Communion and fellowſhip with Chriſt, than to Jews and Infidels, and ſuch as are called Chriſtians, but little better than they? Would you not have him make more of his children, than of common ſervants? While you would raiſe up a right unto wicked men to Gods inner Ordinance, you do but depreſſe and lay low the difference and favour, which he vouchſafes to his Covenant people; A King may ſend a Proclamation of pardon to rebels, while the Sword is in their hand, but he ſeals it not to them, or invites them to his Table, till they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and accept conditions.</p>

                        <p>No private grudge, or diſtance, or animoſity of any man in authority can warrant the diſpoſſeſſion of any juſt right of a Communicant to this Ordinance. I have told you already, We are not Lords of the Sacrament, but Stewards; the Table is the Lords Table, not ours; No ſervant can upon any private grudge againſt his fellow-ſervant forbid him the houſe or table provided by the Maſter; No private Citizen can forbid the priviledge and rights of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to his fellow-citizen; This is but the exerciſing of private revenge by the way of Gods publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and to proſtitute the ſame to our envy and malice; <hi>The King ſaid to his ſervants, binde him hand and foot, that hath not the wedding-garment, and take him away,</hi> Matth. 27. 13. The King ſaid it, Let all the Lords ſervants take heed of caſting out any, but upon the Lords warrant, and upon his command. I ſhould tremble that my ſelf, or any elſe ſhould make my Office ſerve my private ſpleen, neither can any man loſe his right upon my ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56580:335"/> or ſuſpicion of ſcandalous ſin, but clear and convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive evidence.</p>

                        <p>And what I ſay of private grudge, I would be underſtood to ſay of private differences in opinion, ſpeculative or practick, provided they be ſuch as godly men do ordinarily diſſent in; or (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith) <hi>Such things wherein the Kingdom of God conſists not,</hi> Rom. 14. 17.

The Anſwer is, That violence muſt not be offer'd to that Rule, Order and way, which God hath ſet down for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting of any viſible member from his right. It's fit that thieves and robbers, and cheaters were either reformed or purged out of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, but yet it muſt be in the courſe of Law, or elſe the remedy would be a miſchief; <hi>That in the mouth of two or three Witneſſes</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 16.) <hi>every word may be eſtabliſht.</hi> It is not a thing to be done at randome, as I have ſhewed; Every ſore leg is not preſently to be cut off, there may be as ſore a one under a ſilk ſtoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: The Church ſinnes, if ſhe neglect her duty; but I muſt tell you, That you muſt do your duty firſt. Have you (in private offences) gone firſt to your offenſive brother, and told him of his fault in private, and then if he be not gain'd, have you born witneſſe againſt him? And hath he been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his ſinne by due conviction? Or doth he ſtand out againſt conviction and admonition? And is he obſtinate, and doth perſiſt in his ſinne? One may murder a Felon, he ſhould haply die,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56580:337"/> but he dies innocently, if he die by a private hand; A man that deſerves to be caſt out, may be caſt out injuriouſly, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>non judice.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Argument is plauſible, That the Church, the livelier and purer it is, the better it is, So the Corn-field is beſt that hath no weeds; The Corn that's clean dreſt from chaffe and cockle is the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, but it's rare to finde ſuch a field, or to finde ſuch a floor in the Garner, ſo it is, but not in the barn-floor. I like holineſſe which is of Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, not that which is of mans making. The <hi>Novatians,</hi> or <hi>Cathari,</hi> the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> alſo pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both to a holineſſe above all the Churches of God in the world, but there is (as <hi>Calvin</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, none of them left in the world to be ſeen, whereas the true Churches of Chriſt continue, and I hope ſhall continue, though they be like <hi>Iſrael</hi> going forth of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> that had a mixt multitude among them, as the Scripture ſpeaks.</p>

                        <p>Before I anſwer this great Queſtion, I muſt tell you that I have cauſe to fear leaſt it be ſaid of me, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid of <hi>Cato, His opinion of, and affection to the Commonwealth is excellent good, but he is offenſive,</hi>

It was an old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, that the coming in of the world into the Church was the decay of Chriſtianity, while Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours were Heathen, and perſecutions of the very name Chriſtian, were frequent, the Diſcipline was vigorous, when men came in to Chriſtianity with no other reſolution, than to ſuffer for it, and made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to ſave nothing by it, but their ſouls, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline was able to keep them in compaſſe, but when Chriſtian Emperours came in, and ſet the broad gates open to the world, then they throng'd into Chriſtianity for faſhion, intereſt, preferment, as all do now upon cuſtom, example, education, and hence is the decay and corruption of Diſcipline, Atheiſts,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:56580:338"/> Epicures, Libertines, every one under form and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Religion, providing immunity and impunity for their own luſts, which having ſaid, and thereby pointed with my finger to the ſore, which I cannot heal, I ſhall anſwer to the Queſtion.</p>

                        <p>1. The ſtrait is great, where there is not a juſt and orderly power to ſeparate or ſever the precious from the vile, to deny their bread to children, or to caſt the childrens bread to dogs, and there will be found a great deal of ſelf-denial neceſſary in this caſe; The affirmative command of giving the Lords bread to his children; and the negative command of not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting pearls before ſwine, are both to be obſerved, and the only expedient that I know is, that both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and people do the duty of their place, without uſurpation of further power, than they have by Gods warrant, and then all will be as well, not as it might, but as it can, as it was in <hi>Hezekiah</hi> his Paſſeover in the ſecond moneth, 2 <hi>Chron. 30. Many in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were not ſanctified,</hi> verſ. 17. <hi>Many came out of the Tribes of Iſrael, which had not cleanſed themſelves,</hi> they did eat the Paſſeover otherwiſe than it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. Here you ſee it was not ſo well as it ought, but it was as well as it could at that time, and therefore <hi>Hezekiah</hi> pray'd, <hi>The good Lord pardon every one that prepares his heart to ſeek God, though he be not according to the purification of the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the Lord healed the people,</hi> verſ. 20. And therefore to ſpeak more particularly to the point; I cannot counſel, but bewail the intermiſſion of the Lords Supper in ſuch Churches where there are a number of worthy Communicants, at leaſt viſibly, though there be no power of juridical excluſion of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:56580:339"/> the unworthy. The <hi>Helvetian</hi> or <hi>Switzerland</hi> Churches claim to be Churches, and have the notes of Word and Sacraments, though this order of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline be not ſetled among them, and I am not he that ſhall blot out their name: There is an expreſſe command, <hi>Do this,</hi> and a very great obligation; There is an excellent benefit of this Ordinance, which if it ſtirre up the thirſt of Gods people to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, or rather claim it at the Miniſters hand, I ſee no ground for the refuſal: I know the Sacraments of ordinary uſe were intermitted in the wilderneſſe, wholly or moſtly, and they were recompenſed with extraordinary, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. but that aroſe on another occaſion than this I ſpeak of; for alas, How many Churches in <hi>England,</hi> or if you will, good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in them, ſhall everlaſtingly be deprived of this high Ordinance, and the benefit of it, ſhall lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the temptation of ſeparation, ſhall loſe this mark of a Church, and ſhall in effect be equally debarred of this Communion with Chriſt, as wicked men are, and that alſo not for any default of theirs, but for their unhappineſs of being planted in a Vineyard that wants a wall or hedge?</p>

                        <p>2. A particular Church having adminiſtration of the Word and Sacraments, is not bound alwayes to want a hedge, pale or door unto the Supper of the Lord, in caſe the Civil Power is not pleaſed to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle or interpoſe in theſe affairs, but are (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) bound to uſe all warrantable means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their ſociety from infection and ſcandal, and the Ordinance from undue invaſion, by giving up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſuch inſpection, as God hath entruſted it with, and themſelves have choſen, and by aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56580:339"/> themſelves with other Churches of God, that the unity may be preſerved of the body of Chriſt, for the Arch is firm by the mutual ſupport of the ſtones, and their joyning to the top-ſtone; For the Church is a body or ſociety with which God hath depoſited his Ordinances, and given it power to meet and aſſemble themſelves together for perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of them, and it were a wonder that they ſhould not have a power of exerciſing them in a right manner.</p>
                        <p>I do not arrogate unto the Church any the leaſt power of outward force or coercion, for that belongs to him that bears the Sword, who if he do not give effect to the cenſures of the Church, yet they have their effect by the conſent of the Church it ſelf, <hi>Ex Diſciplina confederata,</hi> as they ſay, which is that by which he that conſents to be of that body is ſubject to the Laws and Rules of it, and is cut off, if he prove a rotten member. To give light to this point, How ſtood the Diſcipline of Synagogues, from which I am apt to think our Chriſtian Churches took much of their pattern? They had a power to diſcommon their own members, and it ſeems to me that their <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, or agreement among themſelves was that which gave effect to their cenſures, <hi>Joh</hi> 9. 22. And what is the government of Colledges, Corporations and petty Courts in Countrey-villages, where the by-Laws and amerciaments and penalties are by agreement, north warting the municipal Laws of the Commonwealth: He that will enjoy the priviledges and freedoms of ſuch a body, muſt be ſubject to the Rules and Laws of that ſociety; and ſo the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches under Heathen Emperours could do no
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:56580:340"/> more but disfranchize their own members from the priviledges of the Church, of which body they had by their own conſent come in to be members, and ſo ſubmitted themſelves to them. The Emperours gave not this power to the Church, but God who gave them his great Charter to be a City and Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his own, did <hi>eo ipſo,</hi> give them this power, without which they might be a <hi>Cyclops</hi> den, or chaos, but not a regular Society; And upon this ground (as I conceive) the Apoſtle reproves the <hi>Corinthians, 1 Cor. 6. &amp; 1 Cor.</hi> 5. for not doing thoſe things to prevent ſcandal, which they were impowred and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to have done as a Church of Chriſtians: And if any man had been of ſuch ſtomack or diſpoſition in thoſe times, as not to have cared a ſtraw for thoſe Church-cenſures, ſo long as the Civil power toucht him not in purſe, body, liberty, it was enough to proclaim him fitter for to be a Heathen than a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; For it's admirable to conſider, as it is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That a Church cenſure, a Suſpenſion from the Communion of the Church wrought more ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and trouble, and heart-breaking, than the fire and faggot of the perſecution: In concluſion and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole matter, as he ſaid of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they muſt <hi>redire ad caſas,</hi> return to their poor ſhepherd cottages again: So I ſay, that in caſe of this neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when the Civil power contributes not aſſiſtance or furtherance to the Church, ſhe muſt conſider the caſe of the primitive Churches, and what intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally belongs to her to do, as a corporation or body of Gods making, with no other power of ſelf preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from ſcandals of members, but purging them out, nor from injuries of forreiners, but ſuffering.</p>

Every particular member of the Church ought to withdraw or refrain from ſuch converſation with a ſcandalous brother, as may either give occaſion of ſcandal to others, or infection to himſelf. The Apoſtle allows civil commerce or entercourſe with Heathens and Infidels, if we live among them, and the bonds of natural and civil relations or duties muſt not be violated on pretence of Chriſtianity, but an arbitrary, familiar and intimate ſociety or fellowſhip with them that live or act ſcandalouſly, doth but ſoil our ſelves, harden them, offend ſober Chriſtians. It's a caution much inculcate in Scripture, <hi>Withdraw from every brother that walks diſorderly,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 3. 6. <hi>Have no company with them, that they may be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> verſ. 14. <hi>Turn away from ſuch wicked formaliſts as have no power of godlineſſe, and under the form of it are ſo wicked,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 5. <hi>With a brother that's ſcandalous, no not to eat,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 9, 12, <hi>Them that cauſe diviſions and ſcandals mark, and avoid them, Rom.</hi> 16. 17.

The Scripture gives us a perfect delineation of the Church, as it ought to be in Rules of faith and holineſſe, but yet ſhews us plainly, that it being Gods pleaſure, that the Net ſhould gather both good and bad, and the ſervants inviting to the marriage did bring in both good and bad; it muſt needs be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, that many of thoſe that are called are not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, <hi>That all that are of Iſrael, are not Iſrael.</hi> Had not this mixture ſerved more to Gods glory, even the glory of his inwardly diſcriminating grace, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it had not been: So that as they ſay of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Greek, Latine, theſe Languages may be pure in books, but hardly to be found purely ſpoken by any Nation now in the world, ſo are the rules of faith and life pure and perfect in the Word, and yet not ſo perfectly obſerved by the viſible Church. And if a man ſuppoſe that a number or Colony of really holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons might be pickt out of the Churches, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body themſelves into a Church, Are they ſure this would be anſwerable to their fancy? Did not the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> dream ſo of themſelves? And what may one think of their children in time? Doth not the pureſt ſeed we ſow come up with ſtraw and chaff? If they hold Communion with the viſible Church, Is it not all one? If they do not, Is it not worſe and more clearly without warrant?</p>

                        <p>The Church may be corrupted many wayes in Doctrine, Ordinances, Worſhip, and this I account the worſt, becauſe it is the corruption of the beſt, as the corruption of bloud that runnes thorow all the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:56580:345"/> body, the poiſoning of Springs and Rivers that run thorow a Nation, is worſe than a ſore finger in the body, or a ground of thiſtles in the Nation, and there are degrees of this corruption, the Doctrine in ſome remote points, hay and ſtubble upon the foundation, the Worſhip in ſome rituals or rites of mens inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or cuſtom. How many Scripture Churches do ye finde thus corrupted, and yet no Separation of Chriſt from the Jewiſh Church, nor any command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the godly of <hi>Corinth,</hi> in the Provinces of <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> or thoſe of <hi>Aſia</hi> in the <hi>Revelation?</hi> I muſt in ſuch caſe avoid the corruption, hold the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Hear them in <hi>Moſes</hi> chair, and yet beware of their leaven; but if corruptions invade the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, the foundation of Doctrine is deſtroyed, the worſhip is become idolatrous, the leproſie is gotten into the wals and ſubſtance of the houſe, and which is above all, If the Church impoſe ſuch Laws of their Communion, as there is neceſſity of doing or approving things unlawfull, or I am ruin'd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, then muſt I either break with God or men, and in that caſe, <hi>Come out of Babylon:</hi> The Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Proteſtants ſo ſeparated from them of <hi>Rome;</hi> it was a neceſſary and juſt Separation, the Lawes of their Communion were ruinous to the ſoul, if we hold it; to the body and life, if we held it not.</p>

                        <p>In ſumme then, and in concluſion of this part about Doctrine or Worſhip, which is but upon the bie to the Queſtion.

And yet I would not be miſtaken by the ſimpleſt man, as if I accounted it ſeparation, if a Chriſtian hear a Sermon, or receive the Sacrament in another Congregation; For he that takes a meal at another Table doth not thereby ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from his own houſe; or if a Chriſtian at liberty to diſpoſe his dwelling, ſhall remove and ſit down under more fruitfull Ordinances; I account not this ſeceſſion a Separation, no more than if being ſickly, and having not health in the City, he remove his ſeat into the Countrey for purer air, becauſe in ſo doing he removes from the City, but renounces not his freedom therein, nor diſclaims in like proportion the Communion of the Church.</p>

                        <p>But now to the point of Separation, becauſe there is found, not kept in the Communion of the Church, but not caſt out of it, ſome ſcandalous for life and converſation, viſibly unworthy of the Ordinance of the Supper; For let it be granted, that in <hi>Adams</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily there be a <hi>Cain,</hi> in <hi>Noahs</hi> a <hi>Cham,</hi> in Chriſts a <hi>Judas;</hi> and if <hi>Cain</hi> go forth, yet <hi>Adam</hi> doth not, <hi>Noah</hi> doth not, <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth not; Let them be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, let not me ſeparate my ſelf; Let the wicked be diſcommon'd, not the godly, for the godly are in the right, and may ſtand in it as a man at his own ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his own houſe, or in his own ground; If others that ought not do intrude, it's they that muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, for they are treſpaſſers, not he that's owner
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:56580:346"/> and in his right. It's very true, ſay you, but they are not caſt out. I anſwer, There may be ſufficient: cauſe to caſt out obſtinate ſinners, and yet not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe for me to leave the Church. I finde that God accepts of ſuch that ſigh and cry <hi>for all the abominations that are done in Jeruſalem,</hi> Ezek. 9. 4. That God commands us, <hi>To have no fellowſhip with the unfruitfull works of darkneſs, but reprove them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 11.

Theſe are duties for private Chriſtians to performe in this caſe; but I finde not that they muſt ſeparate from Communion in Ordinances upon that cauſe. For I pray you conſider,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Haply there is no Rule in the Word, or no proof by ſufficient evidence of the fact, or no competent Authority by which ſuch a ſinner, as thou inſtanceſt in, may be caſt out, And ſhall this be done diſorderly? Shall one diſorder be rectified by another?</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>And indeed the Argument is conſiderable, If God afford his Communion with a Church by his own Ordinances, and his Grace and Spirit; It would be unnaturall and peeviſh in a childe to forſake his Mother, while his Father ownes her for his Wife.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, The preſence of wicked men at Gods Ordinances pollutes not them that are neither acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to their ſinne, nor indeed to their preſence there. If the Ordinances be polluted by the unclean, to themſelves it is polluted, not to me, <hi>He ſhall bear his own burden; He eats and drinkes damnation to himſelf,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 29.

And why did not the wicked Jews pollute Chriſts Communion in the Ordinances of God in that Church?

                        <p>Secondly, There is difference to be made between the qualifications of a man to his admittance to this Sacrament, and the qualifications of him unto the inward grace, benefit, or effect of it: If one be a baptized perſon, a knowing profeſſour of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, againſt whom there lies no barre of notorious ignorance or ſcandal, though it appear not that he is truly regenerate and ſincere in grace, yet he hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance, he claims upon ſuch a right, as the Church cannot juſtly diſallow, no more than an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> circumciſed and clean could be debarred the Paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; but as to the effect and benefit of the Supper to his ſoul, there is required more than ſo, even true faith in Chriſt, and regeneration, that he may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſuch graces as the benefits are promiſed unto, and come to the Seals of the Covenant with the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Covenant; The wiſe Virgins cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the fooliſh from waiting with them, for they have lamps as well as they, but the Lord ſhuts the door againſt them from entring in with him, for their oyl was out.

                        <p>I have given two Reaſons, the one taken from the ſignification, the other from the end of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Sacrament, to prove that it is not ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a converting Ordinance, and have ſhown you, that though a man may be converted at this time, yet that proves not the inſtitution of it to that end no more than if a ſick man be to take a medicine, and prayer be made for the proſperous ſucceſſe of that medicine, and by ſomething ſuggeſted to the minde of that man by that prayer, whereby he is converted, therefore the medicine ſhould be called a converting Ordinance, becauſe the inſtitution of an Ordinance
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:56580:354"/> leads on the denomination of it, and ſo have alſo ſhown you, that upon this ground miſ-laid and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, we cannot allow of all unconverted mens coming or invitation; The Word is indeed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Ordinance, and therefore thoſe that believe not, that oppoſe themſelves, that are dead in ſinnes, may be admitted and invited to it; If they come not with faith, they may come for faith; If they come unclean, they may yet come to be cleanſed; but the Lords Supper is not of that nature. It is a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ordinance, and preſuppoſes ſome foundation laid by the Word, that it may have effect; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Ordinance muſt go before the confirming; the qualifications of a receiver are not the ſame with the neceſſary qualifications of a hearer; and (which I conceive Divines mean in part by requiring Baptiſm before the Supper) the grace properly ſealed in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme is neceſſary to the obtainment of that grace which is properly ſealed in the Supper; As Chriſt waſht his Diſciples feet before he celebrated and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred this Sacrament. It's true, God hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, that we ſhould not call any man common or unclean, as <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 28. that is, legally, or unclean by his Nation, as if the diſtance and partition wall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> was yet ſtanding, but morally unclean there are ſtill, and we may call them ſo, or elſe we muſt call evil good, and this uncleanneſs is not proper to the ſinners of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but even <hi>Jews</hi> by nature; Chriſtians (as I may ſay) by nature are many of them unclean, wherein I would not confirm them, but endeavour to waſh them from it.</p>

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:56580:356"/> degree of grace may be beſtowed, and without that Faith, doth not impart any grace at all; As the life maintain'd by meat and drink is the ſame life; Doth it therefore follow that meat and drink may convey life into a dead man, becauſe it maintaines it in a living? No: It's true, the ſame life in a dead man would make him live, but the life maintain'd in a man by meat and drink is therefore maintain'd, becauſe there is a life in the man that can eat and drink, receive nouriſhment, by which the meat is made nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and lively, which otherwiſe could not be; And ſo there muſt be life in the Patient, elſe the Plaiſter or Medicine, if applied to a dead man, would not recover or ſtrengthen life: I deny not but if the Sacrament could convey the ſame grace to a dead man, as it doth to a living, that dead man would live, but that it cannot doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it works by way of nouriſhment, which the dead receive not.</p>

Three things I would have you bear in minde.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That theſe words referre to the manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating, and conſequently to the act, or actual receiving of the Sacrament; and therefore the Text ſaith, <hi>He that eats and drinks unworthily,</hi> theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial expreſſions denote the mode or manner of the act, and cannot be applied to any man out of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That yet they connote ſome aptitude, or inap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, ſome fitneſſe or unfitneſſe of the perſon from whence this manner of the action doth proceed, as acts referre to ſome habit or diſpoſition, whence they ariſe, and ſo we call a worthy or unworthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant, one that hath or wants ſuch qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or ſuch frame of ſpirit as is apt to bring forth ſutable actions, and theſe qualifications deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the perſon antecedaneous to the act, as we call a valiant man, before we fight; a worthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant, though not in the act; we need no place
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:56580:358"/> of Scripture to name a Communicant worthy or unworthy, for if it denominate the act worthily, unworthily, then Logick and Reaſon will ſuppoſe an aptitude or diſpoſition of the perſon whence this act comes.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That howſoever in our Engliſh uſe, and ſo in the Latine, we mean by worthineſſe and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſome perſon or action, an extraordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or excellency, or an extraordinary poorneſſe and baſeneſſe, yet here the words muſt be interpreted relatively, that is, in relation to the Ordinance, and ſo they import no more then fitly, condecently, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably, becomingly, or contrarily. If the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of eating or drinking be anſwerable to, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming of the Ordinance, being ſuch as the exigence and nature thereof doth demand or beſpeak of us, then we receive it worthily; for as you cannot tell, whether a man act a part well, unleſſe you know what part it is, the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:56580:358"/> them two or three Corollaries, or Cautions requiſite to ſtand in the front of my following Diſcourſe for prevention of miſtake of my words.</p>

This Rule prevents a great deal of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity and trouble, which Chriſtians create in themſelves to their diſcouragement, falſly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that they have not, haply never have received worthily, becauſe they finde not the after-fruit an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to their expectations, they finde not ſuch elevations of ſpirit, ſenſible joyes, powerfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over their particular luſts and corruptions, not that vigour and increaſe of ſome particular graces, which they in their expectation, have (as it were) li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited God to beſtow upon them by the uſe of this Ordinance: I do not take off a Chriſtian from wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on God in the uſe of this Ordinance, for thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and graces which it's properly ordained to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part: but I deny the concluſion thence inferr'd, therefore I have not received worthily, for it is the ſpiritual manner of the performance of the act, muſt be Judge of that, and not the ſenſible fruit and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit actually enjoyed, for thou mayeſt, as I may ſay, wreſtle with God, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, and yet go away halting, that was no ſign of prevailing, yet the Text tels us, <hi>by his ſtrength he had power with God, he prevailed;</hi> Oh but he went lame away, True, <hi>but he wept and made ſupplication to him,</hi> Hoſ. 12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:56580:359"/> it prevail'd not at firſt for removal of the thorn, nor with God neither, but he had his eye open'd to ſee the uſe of that thorn, like a corroſive to eat away the proud fleſh growing, and that contented him, the ſtay of the thorn was anſwer to his prayer, when he ſaw the uſe of it, and was ſupported under it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8. We look for Gods anſwer to us in our prayer, or in his Ordinance, as that man that lookt for the Sunne riſing towards the Eaſt, whereas he that looked Weſt-ward for it on the top of the high Tower or Steeple, ſaw it firſt: To ſee and to have the uſe of a ſinne or corruption, is a better anſwer of an Ordinance many times, than to be quit of it; For (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaies) <hi>Proud hearts have need of ſinnes as proud ſores of eating plaiſters;</hi> And therefore to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this point nearer home, and nearer the caſe it ſelf. The Apoſtles that were near Chriſt at this firſt Sacrament, within few hours after it betray'd their weakneſſe, they fled from him, they hid themſelves, and the ſtrongeſt of them took the greateſt fall; Shall we ſay they communicated unworthily, becauſe the ſucceſſe was ſo bad? No, for we muſt not meaſure altogether by that Rule, but by the manner of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; if ſuch graces and affections be then ſet on work, as the Ordinance doth beſpeak; It's well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the recording of the ſinnes of holy men in Scripture, is as profitable and uſefull to the Church, as the record of their graces or heroical acts; For as we look upon their graces, we are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of our ſelves, and inſtructed to imitation, as we look on their ſinnes and failings, we are not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged unto deſperation, and the Scripture it ſelf di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us to ſome ſuch like uſe, <hi>Jam. 5. 17. Elias was a
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:56580:359"/> man ſubject to like paſsions as we are,</hi> viz. <hi>to like afflictions,</hi> and to like fruit trees. It's Gods part of the Covenant to finiſh our faith and ſupport our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to revive our ſpirits, and ſubdue our corruptions. It's our part to believe and walk humbly with God, not only in our converſation, but the uſe of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; Let us minde our own part, and take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the acting of grace at leaſt, if we have not the deſired benefit and fruit of Ordinances to comfort us; For were I to chuſe, I had rather exerciſe grace in my communion with God, than enjoy a ſenſible ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; I ſpeak it to improve a Chriſtian in his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actings, though I know withall that at laſt the fruit will fall into his boſom; for he that goes out weeping, and bears precious ſeed, ſhall doubtleſſe come again with joy, and bring his ſheaves, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 126. 6. And again, <hi>Hoſea 6. 2. After two dayes he will revive us,</hi> in the third (as Chriſt was raiſed) he will raiſe us up, then ſhall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord; in the mean time before this fruit be ripe, the very running of the ſap is a certain ſigne the Tree lives. And ſo I have given you a meaſure or rule of judging, whether you receive wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Think not that the Sacrament conveyes or contributes any thing to you as a medicinal potion or plaiſter; Doth the Phyſick work, and ſo the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, by an inherent or inward vertue in it ſelf, not by any vertue in the Phyfician or Chyrurgeon? So ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and ſuperſtitious people look on the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they think it ſaves them, and does them good, they know not how, and ſo regard the matter more than the manner of receiving, they miſtake Gods
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:56580:360"/> manner of working by Sacraments, and therefore regard not their own manner of receiving them, and are ſo fond, as if they could eat and drink away their ſinnes, and had by very receiving this bread and wine quit all old ſcores, and were freſh to begin upon a new account, as the Papiſt thinks of his auricular confeſſion.</p>

                        <p>It is a very excellent and profitable knowledge to underſtand how God conveys grace by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I ſpeak not of underſtanding ſubtilties, but the plain and open uſe of the Ordinance. Now I cannot poſſibly conceive, how the elementals of bread and wine, can or do any otherwiſe convey to or afford me any ſpiritual grace, but as inſtruments and means by Gods meer poſitive appointment and ordination, repreſenting, teſtifying, ſealing to me not only Gods reality of promiſe or Covenant in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Chriſt, but my intereſt and propriety in Chriſt, and the benefits that flow from Union and Communion with Chriſt; and therefore that revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, refreſhing increaſe of grace, power of morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of luſts, Come no otherwiſe to me by the uſe of this Ordinance, than as it ſeals Chriſt to me, and by ſealing Chriſt or the Covenant to me doth confirm faith, revive the heart, elevate the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſtrengthen reſolutions, fortifie againſt luſts and temptations; for it is a ſure Rule, The nearer appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Chriſt to the ſoul and his benefits in way of taſte or aſſurance, the more quickning grace of all ſorts, follows thereupon; As the nearer approach of the Sunne in the Spring, cheers up and revives all things that live, but things ſtark dead are as dead then, as in deep of winter. Let me convey this to
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:56580:360"/> you by a familiar ſimilitude; A man hath an Eſtate, the Wool, the Wine, the Corn that grows out of that Eſtate clothes him, refreſhes him, feeds him, but the Seal that confirms and aſſures this Eſtate to him, doth no otherwiſe cloath, or refreſh, or feed him, than as it confirms that eſtate to him, out of which all theſe do riſe: And by this you may plainly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how grace is conveyed by this Sacrament, which doth ſeal up to you, and aſſure you of Chriſt, and the Covenant of promiſes in Chriſt, out of which all theſe graces grow and flow: Do ye underſtand this? Then it follows,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That for any man to imagine that the very eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking this bread and this Cup ſhould cure and heal his ſoul, is as fond as to think the very ſeal or wax of a Deed ſhould either ſeed or clothe him, for in that caſe it's not a ſeal, but a piece of wax, how infinitely do our common people undervalue this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that make but a piece of holy bread of it, which is an exhibition of the body of Chriſt, as they that value a ſeal by the worth of the wax, and not by the Eſtate thereby confirmed.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That it's abſolutely neceſſary to bring to this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that grace which is neceſſary to the receiving of Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Quid paras dentem?</hi> What does the providing of teeth to eat (ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi>) What avail is all outward preparation? The thing that is exhibited to us is Chriſt his body broken, his bloud ſhed, Chriſt dying, Chriſt a Sacrifice offer'd up to God is here commemorated, and is here offer'd, and that inward grace which is neceſſary to receive and cloſe with Chriſt, muſt be brought with you; That grace is found by and from the word, and that grace
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:56580:361"/> muſt be uſed here, and exerciſed. The Covenant requires it, and the Seal is the Seal of the Covenant; You cannot take the Seal and leave the Covenant, you cannot enter Covenant without faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, you do but expect that the Seal ſhould ſeal a lie to you, if you expect remiſſion of ſinnes to be ſealed without your faith in Chriſt. It's impoſſible that the Word and Sacrament ſhould be oppoſite, as that the Covenant and Seal thereof ſhould diſagree. As therefore if one would know what a Seal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys or confirms, let him reade the Deed, and the Conditions of it, and there it is learn'd, So if you would know what the Sacrament ſeals to you, hear what the Word ſaith, Mercy and Grace to a believer in Chriſt, and to no other, which he that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from this fountain, muſt bring his veſſel with him, for <hi>qui fide vacuus, foras manducat non intus</hi>

And your worthineſſe is rather the ſenſe of your unworthineſſe: Thus the Goſpel conſtrues theſe high ſounding words, and the reaſon is, becauſe the Goſpel placing our righteouſneſſe and our happineſſe in the having of Chriſt, and taking every man utterly off his own bottom, doth thereby come to a new reckoning, that is not uſed in the whole world, and accounts them full that are moſt empty, rich that are poor, bleſſed, that are in their own ſenſe, or outward condition, miſerable, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing all things, that have nothing; and ſo in this point in hand, according to <hi>Luther</hi>'s paradoxal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, which our <hi>Whitaker</hi> approves, is <hi>Eſt optime diſpoſitus, qui eſt peſsime diſpoſitus,</hi> He is moſt worthy that is moſt unworthy, <hi>viz.</hi> that is ſenſible of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſſe.</p>

                        <p>1. There is a certain peculiar preparation due to the celebration of this Ordinance; for where the

Nature induceth not a new form without preparing the matter. Art as it helps, ſo it imitates nature, elſe that which is medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal may be mortal; Our Saviour did not only uſe, but honour preparations, when he faſted and pray'd in order to his great work; To the Paſſeover there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd <gap reason="foreign">

For doe we not prophane our eyes by wandring, our tongues by talking, our faces by laughing, and the Ordinance of God by all? I would there were not cauſe to wiſh that our publick meetings had more compoſedneſſe of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward behaviour, but when ſometimes, and in ſome places the Pulpit looks like a ſtage, and the houſe of prayer like a play-houſe; we may juſtly fear leaſt a <hi>Corinthian</hi> rudeneſſe come up to the Lords Table al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and think it needfull to reprove ſuch lightneſſe, as is offenſive to ſerious devotion or common gravity.

                        <p>3. By having thoſe graces which are to be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſet on work at the Lords Table, a believer ſhall try and judge of his fitneſſe to come unto it. I ſhall ſhew you in the next, That the exerciſe of grace is requiſite unto the act of receiving worthily, but it is the having of that grace, whereby a man ſhall try and judge of his fitneſſe to come; For (I ſuppoſe) firſt, that there is ſome previous diſpoſition or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which gives capacity or meetneſſe to come to this Table, as the word, <hi>Let a man examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo let him come,</hi> doth clearly prove, and then that this fitneſſe or habitual qualification is the having or exciting of thoſe graces which are to be exerciſed and ſet a work; As a ſouldier is accoutred
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:56580:365"/> and furniſht with ſuch weapons, as in fight are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed and uſed, and therefore a Chriſtian that would try or know his own fitneſſe or worthineſſe, confiders firſt what graces are to be ſet on work in the act of receiving, and then examines whether he have them before-hand or no: Plain ſenſe and reaſon ſhews, that a dead man is not fit to eat and drink, becauſe he cannot exerciſe any act of life, without which he neither eats nor can be refreſht, and therefore we muſt conclude, that there is an habitual fitneſſe required to be in the perſon that communicates wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily.</p>

I have no warrant to ſet the mark ſo high, that the leaſt of Gods children qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, ſhould not reach it; for I confider, that this Sacrament was ordained for the Church, during the eſtate of imperfection, and for remedy of weakneſſe and infirmity, not like the Tree of Life, which man was debarred from, for his ſinne in the forbidden fruit; and as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, <hi>A childe may receive a Ring as well as a Gyant, and the leaſt Candle points upwards as well as the greateſt Torch.</hi> Great Maſters of Families (as the Prodigal obſerved) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the meaneſt of their domeſtick ſervants to come to the Tables end, and eat of their bread.

                        <p>The actual exerciſe of our graces is requiſite to our eating and drinking worthily. The inſtrument muſt be in tune before-hand, as I ſhew'd you in the former, but now the ſtrings are ſtricken, now they make their muſick. The activity and imploiment of our faith and affections is now required, and our graces muſt be on their wheels; now the ſails are ſpread to catch the gale which ſweetly breathes from this holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, for here it's ſaid, <hi>Take, Eat, Take and drink;</hi> and as the eye, the hand, the mouth are now in actual imploiment, as to the Sacrament, or outward part, ſo faith which is the eye, hand, mouth of the ſoul, and all the affections are to be actually imploy'd, as to the inward thing, the body and bloud of Chriſt; Not the having of an eye, but looking up to the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Serpent healed the biting. It's not enough to have faith, but we muſt believe. Now that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is in uſe, now muſt our graces be in uſe too. Now that God actually offers and preſents Chriſts body and bloud to my faith; Now let the hand of faith go forth and take Chriſt in. Awake my faith, and ſee the atonement of my ſins in the broken body of my Saviour! Awake repentance, and hear the ſtrong cries, and ſee the dolefull agony of him that bears our chaſtiſement! Awake my memory, and call to minde that <hi>Aegypt</hi> wherein I was, and the bloud of the Paſſeover which removed the deſtroying Angel from my ſoul! <hi>Awake all that is within me to bleſse and praiſe the Lord.</hi> Oh let this Croſſe crucifie my luſts and paſſions!

Now that God ſhews forth to methe death of his Sonne for me, let me ſhew forth that death of Chriſt to God again, as that which I ſtick unto, and abide by, for my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and peace with God. Alas, if my graces be now aſleep, they are next a kin to dead; We might have ſweet, we might have fruitfull Sacraments had we but lively graces; Graces upon their wing, not lying ſullen, and benum'd with cold, therefore blow up your graces, as the Apoſtle his phraſe is, blow the ſmothering fire, the embers into a flame by pertinent meditation; <hi>Be ye lift up ye everlaſting doors, that this King of glory may come in;</hi> And that I may ſpeak to the comfort of a godly ſoul, Let grace run forth at what tap it will, ſo there be but vent, whether at the uppermoſt of high praiſes, or at the lower of melting humblings; If the fire flame, riſe high, thou haſt more comfort; If it ſmoak, God will not quench-it, and that's ſome comfort: Some have a finer taſte, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh their meat with higher guſt and more delight than others, and yet others be nouriſht as well, as much as they; So haply ſome receive Chriſt with greater delectation, and yet thy ſoul may be nouriſht as well as theirs.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>That a man who is in a ſtate of grace, and ſo god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, may yet receive the Lords Supper unworthily, and without effect, not for want of habitual fitneſſe or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, but for want of the actual exerciſe of grace at preſent, or becauſe of ſome diſtempers which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take and ſurpriſe him in the act of communicating.</hi> This Point it may be at firſt ſight looks ſtrangely, but upon conſideration will be found too true; For if we look back to the Paſſeover, we finde, that an <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite</hi> circumciſed, and ſo qualified to eat the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, yea a true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> might be unclean at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, and ſo uncapable of keeping it; And we have at home in this Text, an example and a proof of this Point. Theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> are looked upon as, and ſuppoſed to be (and no doubt ſome of them were)
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:56580:369"/> godly and regenerate perſons, who yet contracted epidemical judgements upon them, <hi>Many ſick, weak, &amp;c.</hi> and that for a ſinne they little thought of, their undue and unfit coming to the Lords Table; they are diſtinguiſht from the world, <hi>verſ. 32, Of whom its ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, verſ. 30. For this cauſe you are judged of the Lord, and chaſtened;</hi> and hence the word <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, is contended to import only temporal judgement in this place. I confeſſe this Point is controverted and diſputed, and more abroad than at home amongſt us. <hi>Vaſquez</hi> ſeems to me to hold, That it is enough that a man be in a ſtate of grace, and that every godly man receives worthily, or elſe ſhould ſinne mortally; But it is no new Doctrine with us, That a regenerate man may ſinne mortally (as they ſpeak) or commit a ſinne meritorious of condemnation; We muſt not leſſen regenerate mens ſinnes, which in divers reſpects are the greater, becauſe the perſon is regenerate; Even they that are babes in Chriſt, may be carnal, and walk as men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>. And therefore <hi>Cajetan</hi> on the other ſide requires actual Devotion, as neceſſary to the fruit of this Sacrament; and his Argument is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Sacrament works according to the manner of its ſignification; And therefore as meat and drink to the end they may nouriſh, do require that we coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate by ſome act of life, to receive and digeſt them; ſo there is neceſſary ſome act of inward grace to meet with and receive this ſpiritual food, that it may nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and refreſh us; and I hold the Argument good and firm; Nor do I finde any priviledge of a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man, that he cannot commit this ſinne: He may be under a ſpiritual Apoplexy or ſtupidity, as
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:56580:369"/> 
                           <hi>David</hi> for a time ſeems to have been: He may be overgrown with a cruſt, a coldneſſe, a ſecurity, and ſo unfit by diſeaſe, though not by death. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> ſaw this truth, when he ſpeaks of ſome that may not eat, becauſe not initiated, <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, unclean. It's true, It is proper to the godly to receive worthily, but it's proper, <hi>Soli ſed non ſemper,</hi> only they do ſo, but not they alwayes, and therefore I turn my ſpeech to you, and deſire that you be not render'd ſecure and negligent by this falſe principle, that a regenerate man cannot receive the Sacrament unworthily, for this is the ready way to fall into that ſinne which you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine your ſelves free from, by taking you off from that ſelf-examination, that trimming of your Lamps, that purging out of the old Leaven, that blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of your Graces into act, which is ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite unto your meeting with your Lord in this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>
                        <p>I know that for the moſt part thoſe do charge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with this ſinne of receiving unworthily, that have leaſt cauſe; The worthieſt Communicants are to their own eye the worſt; They never acted their graces lively at the Sacrament; They never felt the preſent delights and fatneſſe of this Ordinance; They have been alwayes incumbred with doubts, with fears and diſtempers, and have often gone away with more anguiſh of ſpirit than they came, and a world of ſuch complaints there are; and I confeſſe it is not ordinary that gracious perſons do ſtand in good opinion with themſelves, but yet <hi>Jacobs</hi> going away halting from God, was not an argument that
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:56580:370"/> he had not prevail'd; Sick people may be nouriſht and ſtrengthen'd with that meat which they cannot taſte or reliſh in their mouth; Grace is more apt to ſee ſinne than it ſelf; for the eye doth not ſee it ſelf, and the more it grows in light, the more tender in ſenſe: In ſpirituals it is true: But I ſhall ſpeak a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, Thoſe diſeaſes we feel and are ſick of, ſeldome prove mortal, that is, when the affections melt with ſorrow, and not the conſcience amazed with horrour, though I would not nouriſh complaints againſt my ſelf, yet I had rather have the ſenſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. wherein he complains of himſelf, than his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, when he ſaid, <hi>I verily thought I ought to do, &amp;c.</hi> and I think a proud confidence both a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cauſe and ſigne of unworthy receiving, than humble fear and ſenſe of imperfection, for even this is a grace to be exerciſed at the Lords Table.</p>

                        <p>THe Graces which are to be exerciſed and ſet on work in the uſe of this Sacrament, are pointed at, and taught us by the Ordinance it ſelf: For when the Apoſtle bids every man to <hi>examine himſelf,</hi> he ſhould leave us in a wilderneſſe and wide world, for he tels us not of what, but that the Ordinance it ſelf is the Rule of this examination, and doth beſpeak thoſe graces which make us fit to come unto it. This is the way that <hi>Chemnitius</hi> goes, whereby to finde what thoſe graces are which inable us to receive the benefit and effect here to be expected: And to me it ſeems an excellent way, For hereby the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant (as I have often ſaid) is made ſuitable to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and the examination is kept within its bounds: So that if any ſhould quarrel, and ſay, You require ſuch things of us, as you have no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for; You lay burdens of your own invention, we appeal to the Ordinance it ſelf, and require nor more, nor leſſe than may be deduced from it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate;
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:56580:371"/> We know that in all Sacraments there is Analogy or proportion, and ſo in this, the elements broken bread, and wine pouned forth, or the body and bloud of Chriſt, the actions of Taking, Eating and Drinking the outward elements, doe denote the acts of a Communicants ſoul, receiving and feeding upon Chriſt, and ſuch acts there muſt be to anſwer unto the outward actions. So as if you tell me of any ſenſible object, it's eaſie to ſhew what ſenſe it belongs unto, for if it be light or colour, it belongs to the eye, if it be any ſound, it belongs to the ear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So this Sacrament being ſurvey'd and ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is not hard to finde what graces are to be ſet on work accordingly: And this Rule, that I may not gueſſe at randome, I ſhall follow in the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, It's neceſſary that the Communicant have knowledge of the Nature, Uſe, and End of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and that is demonſtrate thus: Here are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward elements and actions, which do ſignifie ſome other thing, as namely, the body and bloud of Chriſt, as himſelf expounds it, offer'd by God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and to be received by the Communicant, and therefore there muſt be knowledge to diſcern and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this myſtery that's hidden under a viſible out-ſide, to wit, the Sacrifice of Chriſts body, which is repreſented, and the confirmation of the Goſpel-Covenant by his bloud; for without this knowledge a man comes blinde-fold, eats and drinks as a bruit, takes the diſh for the meat, and is no otherwiſe refreſht than a thirſty man would be by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſucking a ſign-poſt, which doth but ſignifie that there is wine within. It was a childes Queſtion,

                           <hi>Exod. 12. 26. What mean you by this ſervice?</hi> And I would our ignorant people would ſo play the childe, for they do but eat the ſhell, and gnaw the bone of the outward ſervice, becauſe they know not the meaning of it; So the carnall Jew knew not the meaning of the Rites and Types then uſed, nor ſaw both Law and Goſpel in their Sacrifices, both which they were full of; I confeſſe the knowledge of this Sacrament draws with it the knowledge of our loſt eſtate, (as Paſſeover is not underſtood without <hi>Egypt</hi>) in ſinne and miſery; For where Chriſt appears blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, there ſinne muſt needs appear deadly, and thoſe fundamentals and grounds of Chriſtianity, which are but the <hi>A. B. C.</hi> of Religion, muſt be knowne, but it is not the knowledge of a Scholar, but the knowledge of a Chriſtian, which we plead for, ſo much as may ſerve to look into the entrails of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and may lead on the affections to value, prize, thirſt after Jeſus Chriſt, whom if we ſee not, we cannot deſire or love, <hi>Viſus eſt prima amor is linea,</hi> fight is the firſt line of love, nor can we believe in him, untill we ſee, <hi>John 6. 40. Whoſoever ſee the Sonne, and believes in him, ſhall have everlaſting life.</hi> I ſhould not charge a poor Chriſtian with any great rate of knowledge, for the quality is more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded than the quantity; If he know both ſinne and Chriſt by taſte, as well as by ſight, if he have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing and favoury knowledge of the things of the Spirit, and there be, as it is in embers, a great heat, though but little light, then is it good, though not great. I know that Queſtions <hi>demodo</hi> in all points of Divinity are hard to anſwer. It's well if we can anſwer a Queſtion <hi>aere.</hi> I may know what ſinne is,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:56580:372"/> and yet not tell how it enters, and comes at firſt into my ſoul. The Apoſtles took Chriſt at this time for their Saviour and Lord, the true <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> but how he ſhould execute all the pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Secondly, This is not all, but it is firſt, as light was at the Creation, the firſt creature, but all the world was not made when light was; He is not wholly fitted that hath knowledge, there muſt be a Chriſt-receiving, or a Chriſt-taking faith, and this is ſhown thus, God offers the body and bloud of his Sonne, which was ſhed for the remiſſion of ſinne, and ſaith, <hi>Take ye, Eat ye, Drink ye,</hi> and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward act, which anſwers to this outward action, whereby we do receive Chriſt that is exhibited we call faith; when Chriſt is tender'd to us in the Word, we believe <hi>ex-promiſſo;</hi> when offer'd in the Supper, we believe <hi>ex pignore;</hi> There we have a promiſe, here a pawn or pledge: This faith is the taking hand, which goes forth to the offering-hand of God. This taking, eating, drinking, are but faith appropriating and applying Chriſt: You ſay, you believe, What believe you? That God offers Chriſt to your faith; What's a poor man the richer for believing that one offers him a ſhilling? What's a condemned man the better for believing that a pardon is offer'd to him? This is but a faith of the truth of the offer; But doe ye receive Chriſt offered? Do you cloſe in with Chriſt? Do you take him into you? Here is the beſt Covenant, ſealed with the beſt blood that ever was; You believe this to be a truth, but come not in to this Covenant, that ſaith doth but ſerve to your juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation;
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:56580:372"/> It is the Chriſt-receiving, not the truth acknowledging ſaith that brings ſalvation to you. If men did but know what ſaving ſaith is, we ſhould have either more or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is not true faith that blows hot and cold out of the ſame mouth, and cries <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to Chriſt a Saviour, but yet I will not have him reigne over me: This Sacrament preſents Chriſt to faith thus, It preſents Chriſt himſelf, his body and bloud, not the benefits of Chriſt apart and abſtract, but Chriſt himſelf. It preſents Chriſt for intimate union with us, as the nouriſhment is to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: It preſents him really, as the bread and wine is really taken and received: It preſents him crucified and ſuffering, as if he was now dving and bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in whom faith findes reconciliation, remiſſion, juſtification and redemption, ſo is it acted and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this Ordinance.</p>

I account gracious deſires to be the immediate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of regenerated graces, and very comfortable teſtimonies of life ſpirituall, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 2. but it is called <hi>vehement deſire,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 11. in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from the ſluggards deſires, which are but wiſhes, and which every man pretneds unto, though it be plaine they are but of <hi>Balaam</hi>'s tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, who deſired to die the death of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but loved the wages of unrighteouſneſſe; God helps his people much by giving them good deſires, both for that they make prayer warme, and give great comfort in the midſt of ſad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, yea they bring us to the Word, and to the Sacrament, where the want which occaſions the deſire may be ſupplied; Keep them alive, and they will keep you alive; Sharpen and whet them as men doe indifferent ſtomacks with vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; Senſe of ſinne, and deſire of grace are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

Humility makes thankfull; The <hi>Samaritane</hi> Leper return'd to give thanks; He was more remote from expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cure, and therefore the more thankfull; The ſenſe of our own unworthineſſe, and of the great diſproportion between Chriſt and us, may raiſe up our thankſgiving to a higher flame.

The <hi>modus orandi,</hi> or manner how the Sacrament works, or contributes to ſpiritual grace, is not of vulgar diſquiſition. I ſignified to you laſt day, that Queſtions <hi>de modo</hi> in all parts of Divinity, are uſually difficult to unty. All confeſſe that Sacraments work by inſtitution of God, as the brazen Serpent healed the fiery ſting, but that is yet too ſhort; For doth Gods inſtitution elevate the nature of the Sacrament to produce the effect? Then is that effect plainly miraculous, and the faith of miracles ſhould be required; Or doth the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God appoint the ſignification and obſignation of the Sacrament in ſuch and ſuch an uſe of it? This indeed is according to rule of Schools and of our Divines, <hi>Modus operandi ſequitur modum ſignifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> and then it's plain, that there muſt be ſomewhat in the Communicant, both to underſtand their ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:56580:376"/> and to receive the obſignation and ſealing by the uſe of them, for otherwiſe they are but <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>That you may have alwayes at hand (as a fyle to ſharpen your endeavours.) ſome brief Motives and Reaſons to awaken you; I ſhall briefly recite and offer to you theſe few.</p>

That as your coming worthily may yeeld a great improvement of your ſpiritual ſtate, ſo your coming unworthily may adde much to your guilt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; The ſame paſſage through the red ſea was ſafe to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by faith, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> aſſaying to do the like were all drowned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 29.

That which is Manna to a believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is to a <hi>Judas</hi> poiſon, as the Ancients ſpeak, and all this is <hi>vitio ſumentis,</hi> through the ſin of the receiver who eats Quails under wrath, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 31. and ſits down to <hi>Haman</hi>'s feaſt, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 7.</p>

                           <p>2. Though a Chriſtian is not altogether to judge of his receiving worthily by the fruitfull ſucceſſe and benefit which he findes, but by the exerciſe of his grace, and by his ſacramental diſpoſition, yet the fruit doth not follow, except there be a right uſe, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy participation of the Ordinance. Some are ſo child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and ſuch ſpiritual ſenſualiſts, that if they have not ſenſible and ſweet joy or comfort, or a preſent remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of their thorn, they conclude they come unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily. It's our fault, that as <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſſe, we limit God to give that we deſire, or elſe murmur and think we have nothing: So it is in this Sacrament, and ſo in our prayers we are paſſionately deſirous of ſerving even our own luſts, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 3. The after-fruit cannot be the meaſure of our worthy receiving, but the preſent gracious frame of ſpirit, and exerciſe of our graces: As by fair and beautifull children we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge of lawfull marriage, but by conſent decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ritely given at the preſent time, and yet the fruit and benefit comes not, but in and by the way of receiving worthily, we judge of our ſelves to be fit gueſts by the wedding garment, not the ſweet taſte of the Supper, and yet we cannot ſit down and eat, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we have the wedding garment. We love a ſweet willing diſpoſition in a childe, ready to do what it can, than alwayes to be crying for plums. God highly prizes thoſe that ſet on work their obediential graces, to obſerve the Law of any Ordinance, and perform it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if we can luſt for quails, and yet murmur at the way of the wilderneſſe, we are too like the carnal

                              <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> There is in all ſpirituall joyes, comforts and raptures, two parts, the one is the fruition of the ſweet of them, the other is the ſerviceable uſe of them to oil the wheels, and with more freedome to perform hardeſt duties of obedience. Now if in this latter reſpect we improve or ſeek them, it's farre the better to like in any Chriſtian, for it's Gods part or ſhare, <hi>The joy of the Lord is your ſtrength,</hi> yet duty is the door by which reward enters, as reaping comes by ſowing, <hi>They that ſow to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit reap life everlaſting,</hi> Gal. 6. 8.</p>

                           <p>3. There is a ſacramental diſpoſition requiſite to a Sacramental Communion, and it is a very ſpiritual diſpoſition, as the Communion is ſpiritual: This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition is not one ſingle grace, but a complexion or temperament made up of divers ingredients, which are not all diſtinctly and eminently acted by every man at this preſent, but ſome of them, as occaſion and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity may require. I have already ſhown you them in general, and told you, that they are beſpoken by the Sacrament it ſelf, and as it were deduced from it. This Sacrament affords us the communion of Chriſts death, where his body broken, and bloud ſhed are ſet before us; Here we communicate of a dying Chriſt, in heaven we ſhall have him as a Tree of life. This is that <hi>epulum foederale,</hi> or Covenant-feaſt made for confederates, God is one party, and the faithfull are the other, and both parties of confederates do (<hi>ſic dicam</hi>) partake of the ſame foederal Sacrifice, Chriſt Jeſus, the bloud of the Sacrifice is offer'd up to God.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:56580:377"/> The ſame bloud in the Sacrament is offer'd and given to us, as it's ſaid, <hi>Exod. 24. 6. Moſes took half the blood and ſprinkled it on the Altar, and he ſprinkled the other on the people, and ſaid, Behold the bloud of the Covenant.</hi> If we underſtood the Ordinance, we ſhould eaſily agree, that a ſacramental diſpoſition is a very ſpiritual diſpoſition, and requires the very pureſt addreſſes that we can make to it, where God himſelf entertains his people with no other cheer than which ſatisfies himſelf, and will have them taſte of that which he himſelf is pleaſed and delighted with, that is (I ſay again) Chriſt Jeſus. Now in this ſo near approach to God, ye have an excellent Rule, as in all other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, <hi>Levit. 10. 3. I will be ſanctified in them that come nigh me,</hi> the caſe was, that two Prieſts had taken ſtrange or other fire, not Gods fire from his Altar, but other fire, common fire, and ſo themſelves became the Sacrifice, for God will not be ſlighted. If we bring fire, and it be not his own but ours, we may be conſumed by it, but he not pleaſed. To which end and purpoſe, that we be not found in this caſe, and under this wrath, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew you that ſtrange fire, or thoſe falſe and inſufficient qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which men draw nigh to God in this Sacrament withall, to their own hurt and prejudice.</p>

                        <p>A Fair carriage of outward life, or a good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of moral vertues is not a ſacramental diſpoſition; but rather ſhew a plethorick conſtitution, a ſelf-fulneſſe, a ſelf-righteouſneſſe, which are the greateſt obſtructions againſt Chriſt that can be: I confeſſe grace often dwels in a worſe houſe, and in rougher natures and conſtitutions; but all the ſtarres do not make day. The metal of theſe vertues is very good, but they want a ſuperſcription upon them; there may be nothing of Chriſt, and he that comes worthily to this Sacrament muſt have ſomewhat of Chriſt in him; or muſt be in ſome neceſſity of him, that he may eat with ſour herbs; A man may come with leſſe ſinne unworthily, I ſay leſſe, than a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Communicant; For it's not the number or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſinne, but the ſenſe of, and repentance for it, that is here conſiderable; A bottle ſtopt with gold receives not ſo much as an empty ſhell; it's Chriſt that muſt be in your eye and thirſt, or elſe your fire is ſtrange fire.</p>

A man may be <hi>humiliatus,</hi> not <hi>humilis,</hi> humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not humble; The Angels that ſinn'd were tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled down into a lower place without any abatement of their God-oppoſing pride, man-oppoſing malice: If God pound thee in a mortar by croſſes, pains, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, dreadfull horrours of conſcience, yet pride lives, an argument whereof is, thou wilt not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thy ſoul on free-grace without ſomething to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend thee to it, and he that hath nothing elſe will have his miſery to be his worthineſſe, and the murmurings which a broken eſtate, and broken bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſpirit do belch forth, what are they but fumes and ſmoke of pride: Cut a Bee in pieces, yet ſhe puts forth her ſting; There are many long for humbling breaches, ſmarting ſorrows, and it may be their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is good, but the bottom is merit and pride moſt commonly, they would make their humiliations their Chriſt: Alas, if God ſhould charge but one ſin in his full weight on thee, it would break thee as a great ſtone an egge-ſhell. Did it not ſo in Angels? Who would be a <hi>Pharaoh, Cain,</hi> or <hi>Judas?</hi> Is not broken iron, broken ice hard ſtill as ever?

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:56580:379"/> of the hardneſſe of it, becauſe it's not encountred with diſcouragements, ſins, temptations, as ſaving faith is, becauſe the whole adventure of the ſoul lies upon it, and God knows when we come to ſhoot the gulf, and to renounce all falſe hopes, or true fears, and caſt our ſelves on Chriſt, we do it with great difficulty, for without Gods attraction it's impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and this is the faith which we muſt be exerciſed in, and which is confirmed by this Sacrament, and a rare faith it is, even in the believing world; For it gives up man to Chriſt, as well as receives Chriſt; And the diſ-intereſſing of ſelf-love, and the intereſſing of Chriſt into preheminence and government is very rare and infrequent; For I count that no receiving of Chriſt, which divides him, and takes ſo much as ſelf-love would ſerve it ſelf upon, but brings not every thought into captivity to the obedience of him.</p>
                        <p>IV. If thou finde in thy affections any appearances or ſeeming impreſſions of grace, be not over-credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous till the bottom be ſearched, for there lies abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſelf-love, and ſelf-intereſt, even when there is a good countenance and fore-ſide; as in the zeal of <hi>Jehu,</hi> which carried in the fore-head of it, <hi>The Lord of hoſts,</hi> but there was a byas within that wheeled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his own intereſt, I ſhall name but four, and that briefly.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. The love of God which is a reflex of his firſt love to us; As the Sun-beams which come from the wall are the reflex of the beams that firſt ſmite upon it, and there may be a love of God upon terms of his beneficence, providence, patience, general good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to mankinde without any love of Chriſt in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:56580:380"/> which is upon ſpecial and diſtinguiſhing grounds, for that love of God which is over-topt by ſelf-love, is not accounted love of God, but rather a luſt of ſerving our ſelves upon him, which is the laſt reſort of the love of moſt men to God, but it may be diſtinguiſht thus, If it ariſe from the ſenſe of that diſtinguiſhing love of God to thy ſoul, whereby he hath drawn thee to Chriſt out of the pit of common perdition, and that without any worthineſſe in thee, or contributions of thine to that ineſtimable grace, yea notwithſtanding that contrariety and oppoſition to him, wherein thou waſt above many others inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the very thought whereof doth ever inflame the heart unto a mans dying day: If it be a love to God for his holineſſe and his ſanctification of thee to bear his Image, and to be like him: If it be a love of complacency and friendſhip, to delight thy ſelf in God, and to affect Union and Communion with him: If it produce a willingneſſe to confederate with him, and to be in league, againſt all intereſts of the fleſh and world: I love my maſter, I will not go out free, or be at my own freedom.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The ſecond affection is deſire of grace, and of ſpiritual things. I conceive there may be a carnal deſire of things ſpiritual, and carnal prayers for ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual gifts, namely to conſume them upon our luſts of pride and vain-glory, which is the deſire of <hi>Simon Magus;</hi> a deſire to die the death of the righteous, which was the wiſh of <hi>Balaam,</hi> a deſire of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne to be freed from condemnation by meer ſelf love, a deſire of heaven too, to open unto us, for happineſſe not holineſſe or communion with God, a deſire comfort to anguiſh of conſcience, and that
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:56580:380"/> rather for eaſe, than for grace, a deſire of grace it ſelf, as a neceſſary bridge unto, or ſigne of ſalvation; <hi>Give us of your oyl</hi> (ſay they) <hi>for our lamps are out;</hi> Many fallacies may be in our deſires, and yet I account them, when they are refined from droſſe, to be moſt comfortable ſignes of ſpiritual life, for Chriſt makes <hi>thirſting after rightcouſneſſe</hi> the character of a bleſſed man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. and the Apoſtle makes them a <hi>fruit of repentance,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 11. and a <hi>ſigne of regencration,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 2. if they ariſe from a taſte of the graciouſneſſe of God, and carry on to the ſincere Word for growth in grace, and be ſpent in endeavours of obedience, and exerciſe of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, equally longing to be Chriſts, as to have Chriſt: He that ſhall deny to a poor ſoul the comfort of ſuch deſires puts out the ſpark that ſmokes in the wick of the candle, when the flame is gone out before.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The third affection is fear, the fear of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Lord, and thoſe puniſhments which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his threats wait upon ſinne. <hi>Eſtius</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the caſe, Whether a man under ſervile fear may come to the Lords Supper? And anſwers, No, but with diſtinction, the fear of wrath may be uſed as a bridle to curb the inſolency and luxuriency of the fleſh, by ſaying hell and damnation cloſe to it, and ſo the regenerate, whoſe fleſh is impetuous, may make uſe of this fear to reſtrain the propenſion of it, but then if this fear be meerly of puniſhment, ſo that were it not for that, he would with all his heart give himſelf over to commit iniquity with greedineſſe, then it's plain, that the willingneſſe to ſinne lives, and this horrour of conſcience nothing at all changes the inclination of the will, no more than the whip or
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:56580:381"/> chain doth the nature of a Fox or Wolf, and the caſe is no other than that of a childe that will colly him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the cole that's black and dead, but dare not touch the fire cole which burnes his fingers, and there is no comfort in ſuch reſtraints from ſinne, nor have ſuch feares any ſparke of grace in them.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The fourth affection is ſorrow for ſinne, which may be worldly and carnal, and no other than <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> his, <hi>Take away this plague;</hi> or the pangs of a whore that returns to folly; But there is a ſorrow according to God, which works repentance unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and brings forth thoſe ſeven fruits, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. which change the frame of the heart, a happy mother of ſo many good children: Theſe are the pangs of a godly ſoul, and it is one of the firſt ſteps unto, or parts of the Reſurrection of a Chriſtian from his fals, and is cauſed not meerly by wrath, but as <hi>Peters</hi> weeping was by the looks of Chriſt; The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, the frowns, the offence of a gracious God, thaws the heart into melting tears, and would do ſo, though there were no hell; As a meek childe needs no other houſe of correction than his fathers looks. I am loath to be of that opinion which baniſhes godly ſorrow out of Religion; For if I were ſo happy as to want new matter and occaſion for it, yet ſometimes to review old forgiven ſins, and the rather, becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given with freſh bleeding heart, doth excellently keep down ſwelling of pride, and gives a freſh and new reliſh to Chriſt Jeſus, ſo the overflowing ſtoods do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich the adjacent grounds, and make them freſh and greene. And ſo much concerning theſe affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                        <p n="5">
                           <pb n="311" facs="tcp:56580:381"/>V. The fifth Conſideration is of purpoſes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, which we named before, among the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives to this Sacrament, which there are few but have at one time or other, and men do exceedingly befool and flatter themſelves in them; For we have known that upon conviction of conſcience and ſhame, for many years together by fits and moods, and for the skinning over ſome gallings of conſcience, men flie to purpoſes of repentance, and put them on, and binde themſelves by vows or other bonds, to doe no more, and yet experience tels us, that <hi>Sampſon</hi> did not eaſilier break the cords that bound him than theſe men do break their purpoſes, and cancell all bonds and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and ſo a ſick mans purpoſes are very often no other than the vows of a Mariner in a ſtorm at ſea, who for the time will be or do any thing, but when the danger is blown over, they are as they were. You ask, What ſuch are to do? And the anſwer is ready, Reſolution without mortification is to little purpoſe, the luſt muſt be mortified that carries the ſway and dominion; For as the purpoſes of a man in his lucid intervals, or of one that hath the Falling ſickneſſe to fall no more, is to little purpoſe, without ſome appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the diſeaſe that ſtill lies within, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and break all dams that are made by the ſtreame of it; ſo are reſolutions upon conviction of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence without effectual exerciſe of mortification by ſetting upon that root and luſt which between whiles doth but ſleep, and will awaken again. Let the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſee and ſearch his ſinne, and apply the corzy of the Law, and uſe thoſe ſharp medicines which eat out a rotten core, and follow that ſharp work of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or elſe all is to little purpoſe.</p>
                        <p n="6">
                           <pb n="312" facs="tcp:56580:382"/>VI. The laſt thing I mention'd was thankfulneſſe, a grace proper to the Euchariſt, which ſignifies thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and is the denomination of this Sacrament, wherein thankſgiving is ſo eminently required and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, and it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>iſes either from the general ground, or from the ſpecial; The general is Gods <hi>Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy,</hi> which ſhews it ſelf in a <hi>ſic dilexit,</hi> by giving Chriſt a Saviour to us, and not to the Angels that ſinn'd, and is worthy to fill our hearts and mouths with admiration to all eternity; But the ſpecial ground is Gods incorporation of us particularly into Chriſt by giving that differencing grace, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes not from Devils, but from reprobates and hypocrites, and all that are called, but not choſen, which is a mark of ſpecial favour; Thankſgiving for this ſhall be the work of heaven, where we ſhall bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtand and look upon our former miſery, as a fyle to ſet off and illuſtrate our glorious redemption, and to this tune ought our hearts to be ſet here, <hi>For in this rejoyce not, that the devils fall before you, but that your names are written in heaven;</hi> and we have cauſe while we are in this lower orb to be thankfull, for the leaſt muſtar-ſeed of faith and grace, whoſe work is to ſet a byas upon the will, to chuſe God, and ſet up his intereſt above all intereſts of ſelf or world, and he keeps this ſpark alive in worſt times by no leſſe a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle than a ſpark of fire in the ſea, and that he inables this little grace to fight and combate (and that is in Scripture to conquer) againſt the powerfull fears and oppreſſions of the world, and the powerfull allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of luſt, and eaſe, and pleaſures of ſinne, which is a Sunſhine that uſually puts out our fire more eaſily than cold and nipping froſts, which rather make it
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:56580:382"/> hotter, and this is the meaning of that phraſe, <hi>He will not quench,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>till he ſend forth judgement unto vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory;</hi> The ſmoak ends in victory.</p>

                           <p>After this digreſſion, the fourth Motive or Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration follows, exciting endeavour to come to this Sacrament in a ſacramental diſpoſition, and that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the benefit or fruit of it to a worthy receiver; for the exerciſe of grace is well rewarded, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and pains beſtowed in preparation or trimming of our Lamps, is paid to us in the fruit and benefit of this Ordinance; And therefore, ſince as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknowledges the Queſtion about the effect is of ſo near a kin to the preparation unto this Sacrament, I ſhall briefly touch the point of the fruit and benefit thereof, and that in theſe two points,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That there is a great benefit and fruit of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance.</p>

                        <head>§. 1.</head>
                        <p>1. THere is a great benefit of this Sacrament to them that communicate therein preparedly; though all be not agreed, what the benefit is, as may be ſeen by the Doctrine of the Papiſts, the <hi>Socinians,</hi> the Orthodox, yet that there is a benefit, few will deny; and if it be denied, the ſenſible experience of many godly Chriſtians doth atteſt it, to which expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the Apoſtle ſometimes appeals, ſaying, <hi>Gal. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>. This onely would I learn of you;</hi> and for others that will not own their experiences, or have them not, reaſon may convince them, That as God made no uſeleſſe creature, ſo he ordains no fruitleſſe inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, that this Ordinance being inſtituted for the uſe of his ſelect people and confederates, and that at ſuch a time as our Lord Chriſt had the very powers of darkneſſe to encounter with, therefore it is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of ſome moment, which began at the death, and ſtands in force until the ſecond coming of Chriſt, and if nothing el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e could be ſaid, this is enough. That the guilt and danger of receiving unworthily being ſo dreadfull, there muſt in reaſon be ſome proportion
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:56580:383"/> of benefit and fruit to the receiving worthily, which reaſon may convince any rational man, that there is not only a good, but that good is of very great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and degree, and that ye ſhall not come for fruit to a barren fig-tree.</p>
                        <p>I have reaſon to demonſtrate both theſe points:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That there is a benefit.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. What that is.</p>

                              <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>2</label> §. 2. That there is much benefit by Worthy Receiving.</head>
                        <p>1. Leaſt this Sacrament of ſo great moment be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified and brought to contempt, as a dry teat or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty veſſel, they muſt needs neglect both the uſe of this Sacrament, and all preparation thereunto that undervalue it, as fruitleſſe and not beneficial; Who will take any pains to go to a dry Well that hath no water in it? It's vain to urge preparations on them that are not perſwaded of any benefit in it; And though I will not diſpute, Whether the ſupream Lord may not oblige his creature, man, for probation and trial of his obedience, to a duty whence no other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit ſhould redound, but the very duty of obedience, As if he oblige <hi>Abraham</hi> by a Law to ſacrifice his ſonne, yet I conceive that Gods ſtanding Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Laws, do not only oblige a duty, but intend a benefit, and thereby invite obedience, as it's ſaid, <hi>Deut. 10. 13. What doth the Lord require of thee, but to keep his Commandments for thy good?</hi> And that therefore there is a benefit of the right uſe of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, by which we may lawfully be excited and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:56580:384"/> impell'd to obſerve the Ordinance, as we climb the tree for the fruit that is upon it; It's true, an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Communicant reaps no other benefit than ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that is like that which the Apoſtle cals, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and profit of the Jew, <hi>Rom. 3. 1. Rom.</hi> 9. 4. viz. <hi>Tabulas &amp; ſigilla foederis,</hi> the Tables and Seals of the Covenant, but the reaſon that he receives no inward and ſpiritual fruit, is not becauſe there is no water in this Well, but becauſe he hath no bucket to draw it forth; For God offers and holds forth Chriſt and the benefits of the Covenant, his hand is not empty, but our hand is full of ſinne and ſelf-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, that we cannot receive it, for they that will receive muſt bring a capacity. It's a known truth, He that means to receive a benefit which is convey'd by way of Covenant, muſt bring the Condition of that Covenant in his hand, as he that comes to a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble brings life and ſtomack.</p>
                        <p>I know there are ſome, and they godly, that fear, or haply will boldly affirm, that they were never ſenſible of the benefit of this Sacrament; They hear of good fruit, but they have not taſted it, and therefore their edge is dull and flat to the receiving of it. To which I anſwer this, That if there be an exerciſe of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces required in the act of receiving, they may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the fruit of the Ordinance, becauſe they are not ſo clearly ſenſible at the preſent, for haply they limit God to the preſent time, or confine their expectations to ſome particular fruit, as elevation of heart, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble comfort, clear aſſurance, or the like, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they finde not, they think they have nothing. I have ſhew'd you before, That God anſwers the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations and ſatisfies the neceſſity of his people by
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:56580:384"/> giving ſome other grace than we would have, or have our eye upon, as <hi>Pauls</hi> prayers were anſwer'd in <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient grace,</hi> not the removing of the thorn; We cry for comfortable ſigns, and God gives o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediential and ſerviceable graces; We look for ſpiritual gifts, he gives humbling grace; We would have conqueſt of ſinne, God gives power to encounter it; We look for lively grace, and God keeps grace alive; We expect at preſent, God after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gives us it; in bodily nouriſhment it's not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a man to tell what degree of nouriſhment he received by ſuch a meal, yet he findes that he lives, and is ſtrengthned, and he may be nouriſht by that which he doth not reliſh with delight. As for thoſe that upon pretence of ſpirit and ſpirituality have caſt off Ordinances, as fruitleſſe unto them, I ſhould wiſh they would conſider, whether they be not rather beſides their wits, than above Ordinances, ſeeing Chriſt himſelf doth not onely by his inſtitution but example, commend this Sacrament unto us, as a ſtanding Ordinance, for the whole Church <hi>untill he come,</hi> and ſo hath commended the Miniſtry alſo, <hi>till we all come to a full ſtature,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 11. I would know how that ſpirit which hath carried them to the pinacle of the Temple, and hath ſet them above Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, or that witneſſes to them without graces, can be proved to be the Spirit of Chriſt, and if they would ſhew us how they can live without meat and drink too, there would be ſome hope that they might be ſtarved into their ſenſes and right minds.</p>

Becauſe ſuperſtitious and carnal perſons do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect what they have no warrant to expect, perverting the uſe of this Sacrament to other intents and ends, than it hath by inſtitution of Chriſt; The ſick man too ſuperſtitiouſly conceives that the <hi>opus operatum</hi> is a <hi>viaticum,</hi> that will pay his fare for a preſent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into heaven, or that it is like a Popiſh ſhrift that blots out all ſinne, and wipes off the old ſcore.

The benefit of the Sacrament is of an higher nature than theſe creatures are able to convey, and therefore they are ſtampt and made inſtrumental by an inſtitution of God; It had been both vain and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious to have expected ſpiritual benefit by the uſe of theſe elements, had not the word of inſtitution given a new relation to them, which without it they have not. There might a ſimilitude or repreſentation have bin borrowed to ſignifie the ſufferings of Chriſt, but that would not have made a Sacrament, any more than marriage repreſenting the myſtical union of Chriſt and the Church is therefore a Sacrament; There muſt be a promiſe and a command of God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the viſible creature, whereby the uſe of it to ſuch a purpoſe is warranted and authorized, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt look higher than the outward elements, or their power; An Axe is more than iron; A Seal is more than wax; Gods inſtitution renders the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of bread and wine (which as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> notes, though two elements are but one inſtrument or ſeal) uſefull to ſpiritual effects, not by elevating their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as the iron or wax being inſtruments are not elevated to any efficacy, as phyſical inſtruments, but by appointing their uſe and working by them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Queſtion, How can bread and wine, How can water reach or touch the ſoul is impertinent? for it refers to a natural cauſation; but moral relation needs no contact, there is a benefit follows upon the right uſe of them, which comes not through them <hi>tanquam per canalem</hi> but from God by the uſe of ſuch means, as an eſtate is convey'd from the donor by a ſeal of wax.</p>

                        <p>So much generally. For the particular, we ſhall conſider,</p>
                        <p>1. What is here done. 2. What is hence received.</p>
                        <p>For the firſt, There is here done by Chriſt two things, and anſwerably two things by a believer in Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Two things principally are here done by God, or by Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Chriſt crucified is really exhibited to the faith of a believer.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The gracious Covenant which God hath made in Chriſt is ſealed to a believer.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Chriſt crucified, together with all thoſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits<note place="margin">More particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</note> that enſue upon his death, is really exhibited to a believer; for there is not a meer repreſentation, or empty figure, but a real and true exhibition of Chriſt himſelf, as broken for our ſinnes. The word <hi>accipite, Take ye, Eat ye,</hi> does evidently confirm it to us; If there were only a reſemblance or figurative repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, then <hi>See ye,</hi> were more properly ſaid, but <hi>Take, Eat, this is my body,</hi> plainly ſhews, that Chriſt himſelf is here given to a believer. I think we look ſo much on the repreſentation, that we forget the exhibition, and therefore ſhould labour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that Chriſt himſelf, as in the ſtate of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming Saviour is truly and indeed holden forth and preſented to our faith, as verily as any benefit can be offer'd and holden forth by one man to another. This body and bloud was really offer'd up to God for us, which is in this Sacrament really offer'd and applied
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:56580:387"/> to us by our faith: Anſwerable to this exhibition of Chriſt himſelf, the believer performs an act of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. partaking of the body and bloud of Chriſt in a ſpiritual ſenſe, for ſpiritual nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, increaſe and building up; for the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is fed and maintain'd by Chriſt, and by vertue of union with him, we have communion, as the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branches by their union with the Vine, receive ſap and nouriſhment; So as we have not graces without Chriſt, nor benefits without Chriſt, but firſt in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature we have union as members of him, and then of his fulneſſe we receive; For a Chriſtian is like a branch that hath nothing of its own, but what it receives from the root, as it ſelf ſprings from the root, ſo the increaſe and growth of it is from the root alſo; He is as the Moon, which, as appears in the Eclypſe, hath no light of it ſelf, but increaſes and comes to full; as it receives from the Sunne; Let no man think that a believer hath no further uſe of Chriſt after his firſt believing and receiving of him, for then this Sacrament would not be uſefull, the effect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as <hi>Durand</hi> ſaith, is not abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, as if one could not be in a ſtate of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without it, becauſe it ſerves for confirmation of one that is already in a ſaving ſtate; and it's plain, that a great par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:56580:388"/> of communion are of prime uſe and benefit, as the branch that ſhoots from the Tree, grows and lives from that root which gave to it the firſt being by a contrived influx of ſap into it. And this is the firſt combination of Gods act, and of ours.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The ſecond combination is, The gracious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which God hath made in Chriſt, is ſealed to a believer; The common nature of a Sacrament is to be a ſeal of Juſtification or Righteouſneſſe with God by faith in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. As a ſeal refers to ſome Covenant, ſo the Sacrament refers to Gods Covenant with man, which is this, That God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to accept into favour, and into his propriety all that do believe in, and receive Chriſt, and to beſtow upon them all the bleſſings and benefits thereof. God gives Chriſt in way of Covenant; He covenants with Chriſt our Lord, that he ſhould <hi>give his ſoul an offering and a Sacrifice for ſin, and in ſo doing ſhould ſee his ſeed, Iſa.</hi> 53. 10. So <hi>Arminius</hi> in this point is orthodox. Of this Covenant the death or bloud of Chriſt is the Condition which Chriſt accepted and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                        <p>The Covenant of God with us is, That all that believe in Chriſt that died, and receive him for their Lord and Saviour, ſhall have remiſſion of ſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of this Covenant the bloud of Chriſt is the ratification, as the Teſtators death ratifies the Will or Teſtament, for it is bloud that doth <gap reason="foreign">

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, dedicated thereby, and this bloud we receive in this Sacrament, as the Seal of the gracious Covenant made with us; So that if
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:56580:388"/> doubts ariſe concerning the reality of God, and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this Covenant that ſpeaks ſo much grace and mercy, we look upon and take hold of this Seale of bloud, and are thereby ſetled, and therein acquieſce.</p>
                        <p>Anſwerable to this act of God, the believer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of, and ſubmits to this Covenant and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it, <hi>viz.</hi> to believe, and to have God for our God, and thereof makes a ſolemn profeſſion in this Sacrament, giving up himſelf to Chriſt, as Lord and Saviour, reſtipulating and ſtriking hands with him, to be his, and ſo bindes himſelf, and doth as it were ſeal a counterpart to God again, and not onely ſo, but comes into a claim of all the riches and lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Will or Covenant, becauſe he hath acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted and here declares his acceptance of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. The Seal is indeed properly of that which is Gods part of the Covenant to perform and give, and is no more but offer'd, untill we ſubſcribe and ſet our hands to it, and then it's compleat, and the benefits may be claimed, as the benefit of any conditional promiſe may be, when the condition is performed; And leaſt you ſhould ſtumble at that word, I muſt let you know, That the Will accepting and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the conditions, is the performance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions required, and ſo the gracious God that might <hi>pro imperio,</hi> require duty and allegiance of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, condeſcends to us to enter into a Covenant of Grace with us, and vouchſafes us the honour of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Covenant with him, that ſo he might ſettle and maintain a communion and correſpondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween himſelf and his people, and there might be a mutual bond of engagement each to other, which
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:56580:389"/> is ſolemnly profeſſed, as often as we meet with God in this Sacrament, becauſe we are ſo apt to disbelieve and waver about his promiſes, and to halt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline from our obligations to him. And this is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond combination of action, according to that which is to be remembred at every ſealing day, (the Sacrament is a ſealing day) <hi>Deut. 26. 17. Thou haſt avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, and to walk in his wayes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the Lord hath avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched thee to be his peculiar people, as he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed thee.</hi> So much for the firſt, What is here done.</p>

                        <p>It is ſomewhat a groſſe conceit to ask, How Chriſt in heaven, and a believer on earth can be united? For man and wife are one fleſh, though a thouſand miles aſunder; And we know, that as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Col. 2. 19. there are bands and joynts whereby the Head and every Member, the root and every branch are united,</hi> and they in this <hi>myſtical union</hi> are <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>faith.

                           </note> confeſſion. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reſolves all the difference between Papiſts and Proteſtants about the effect of this Sacrament into this, That the Papiſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the Proteſtants hold remiſſion of ſinne to be given here, and the Papiſts do it in favour of their Sacrament of Pennance, that one Sacrament may not rob another, but Scripture tels us, <hi>Matth. 26. 28. This is my bloud of the New Testament which is ſhed for many for remiſsion of ſinne;</hi> Shed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, that's true, ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> not given in the Sacrament, a meer evaſion, for we drink the bloud that was ſhed, even that which confirmes the New Teſtament, which promiſes remiſſion of ſinne. The great Argument wherein he triumphs before the victory, is, That a believer hath remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes before he comes, <hi>viz</hi> by his faith in Chriſt, and that's true, <hi>Nemo cibum Chriſti ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipit niſi actu ſanatus,</hi> but in this Sacrament the pardon paſſes <hi>obſignante ſigillo,</hi> before a believer is pardon'd by the Covenant; and here that pardon is ſeal'd, and ſealed it cannot be, except it be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the pardon of forgiven ſinnes is ſeal'd, as <hi>Abraham received the ſigne of circumciſion, the ſeale of the righteouſneſſe of faith, which he had before, Rom.</hi> 4. 11. And this is needfull for reliefe of our doubts, and fears, and waverings; For this
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:56580:390"/> is the great Queſtion of anxiety, which troubles the ſoul; Are my ſinnes pardon'd? Are my ſins blotted out? And God hath, ſaith <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> inſtituted this Sacrament for ſolution of this Queſtion, to the weak faith, <hi>Ecce ſignum,</hi> Behold the Seal, believe upon the Word, believe upon the Seal of God. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> gathers it by a gradation, <hi>The Cup is put for the Wine, the Wine ſignifies the bloud, the bloud is the bloud of the New Teſtament,</hi> Matth. 26. 28. The New Teſtament containes the gracious pardon of ſinne to a believer; And if remiſſion of ſinne be an Article of the Covenant, the Seale muſt reach it; Therefore all that have wounded their ſouls with grievous ſinnes be wounded again with ſorrow, put off the purpoſe of ſinning, bring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and faith, touch the hemme of Chriſt, receive here the pardon of ſin, queſtion not the Seal or truth of it.</p>

The Chriſtians in perſecuting times, when a ſtorme was coming, then were they moſt diligent to frequent this Table, to lay in ſtore for a hard Winter, and fortifie their reſolutions. And let this Benefit be a Motive to the uſe of Preparation, which was the reaſon I have handled it in this place, for there is no Promiſe, no Benefit to one that comes to this Table unworthily.</p>

                        <p>There is a ſpeculative diſcerning of the Body of Chriſt, and there is a practical.</p>
                        <p>The ſpeculative diſcerning is the notion or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſignification of the outward elements.</p>
                        <p>That the Bread and Wine do repreſent Chriſts Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Bloud, That the Bread broken repreſents his Body broken <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is an eaſie piece of knowledge, as eaſie as to know that a picture or figure do repreſent ſuch a man, and there is no great meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to conſtrue all parts or rites of the Sacrament in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a true meaning.</p>
                        <p>In this ſenſe not to <hi>diſcern the Lords body</hi> is directly to inhere and ſtick in the bread and wine, as bread and wine, and to take the picture for the man: It may be there be ſome ſuch bruitiſh ignorants, that diſcorn not the meat from the diſh, nor the marrow from the bone, ſuch as theſe are, are fit to be excluded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe where there is no Analogy holden, there can be no Sacrament. The Analogy, I ſay, between the outward Sacrament, and inward thing, muſt either be known, or it is to us no Sacrament; For a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, reſemblance, or Analogy, muſt be between two things at leaſt, and therefore thoſe that in a blinde and bruitiſh ignorance know nothing, but the outward part do not properly receive a Sacrament, but are like the carnal Jews that knew not the meaning of their Sacrifices, or of thoſe types of Chriſt which they had; The brazen Serpent was Chriſt, the Rock they drank of was Chriſt, but many of them dream'd not

                        <p>The practical diſcerning of the Lords body is, when the body and bloud of Chriſt are ſo minded and intended, as to compoſe the inward man, and the outward behaviour of the Communicant into ſuch a poſture of ſpirit and carriage, as is ſuitable to Chriſts body and bloud there offered and exhibited unto faith, and the not diſcerning the Lords body, is when the behaviour is ſo looſe and rude, the inward man ſo diſcompoſed and carnal, as that interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, they may be ſaid not to minde, or not to <hi>diſcern the Lords body;</hi> So we would ſay of one whoſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is wanton and looſe in the preſence of his fathers corpſe lying in preſence in a coffin or beer, you doe not minde, you conſider not who lies there, becauſe if he did, another countenance and carriage would beſeem him, and ſo the <hi>Corinthians</hi> are taxed here for ſuch carriage of theirs, as proclaim'd they had no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts, no ſad and fixed minde upon Chriſt bleeding and broken, for that conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would have beſpoken another frame of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and forme of behaviour. The reſult of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is,</p>
                        <p>The Apoſtle gives us a two-fold cauſe of

                        <p n="1">1. The Papiſts, and no leſſe the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> doe hence infer, <hi>That the very Body and Bloud of Christ is eaten and drunk by the mouth of the Communicant,</hi> which they call <hi>Sacramentall eating,</hi> and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, How elſe is an <hi>unworthy Receiver guilty of his Body?</hi> We of our Confeſſion that hold the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Preſence of Chriſt under the Bread impoſſible, as well as falſe, do therefore inferre, That that Body which is not corporally there cannot be eaten, and therefore the guiltineſſe of Chriſts Body is not by the oral eating.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. We expound it thus, Whatſoever irreverence, ſlightneſſe, neglect or contempt is uſed by any in the celebration of this Ordinance is reputed and adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to redound to the very Body and Bloud of Chriſt: As it's Treaſon againſt the State to embaſe their coin, to abuſe a Picture is diſhonour to the perſon, to hang a man in effigie, or ſubvert ones Statue (as the <hi>Romans</hi> uſed) are interpreted to the diſgrace of the man whoſe they are; And thus it is here, by reaſon of that near relation and analogy which this Bread and Cup have to Chriſt himſelf, ſo the uncircumciſed man-childe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 14. is ſaid to have <hi>broken my covenant,</hi> and therefore the Fathers reckon an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receivers ſinne to be like that of <hi>Judas,</hi> the Jews, the Souldiers, that abuſed and diſhonour'd the very Body and Bloud of Chriſt; and this is a peculiar
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:56580:397"/> guilt that attends upon the celebration of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, wherein Chriſt condeſcends to come ſo near us, by offering his Body and Bloud to us, and this condeſcention to be neglected and refuſed; Think of this, and meaſure not the ſinne by your own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of it, but by the account which God makes of it, who accounts all them that come unworthily to vilifie the Body, the ſufferings of his Sonne our Lord, and to deſpiſe the Seal of that gracious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which we make our ſelves believe we doe not do.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. The ſins of wicked Chriſtians againſt Goſpel-Ordinances are of higheſt nature, and incurre greater guilt. It's ſaid of Chriſtians, <hi>That after illumination and taſte fall away, they crucifie to themſelves again the Sonne of God, and put him to open ſhame,</hi> Heb. 6. 6. And they that ſin wilfully after the knowledge of the truth, are ſaid <hi>to have trodden under foot the Sonne of God, and counted the bloud of the Covenant a common thing, and to have done deſpight to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace,</hi> Heb. 10. 19, 26. A meer Heathen is out of capacity of guiltineſſe of theſe high ſinnes; He is not guilty of the Body and Bloud of the Lord, which was never offer'd to him in this Sacrament. No ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of ſinne are like to the aggravations of the ſins of wicked Chriſtians, their guilt is not of ſo high complexion that never knew of Chriſt; either we muſt be ſaved, or we cannot be ſo eaſily damned, the weight of ſins againſt Chriſt is heavier than of thoſe that are meerly againſt the Law of God; We are the earth that drinks in the rain that cometh upon us; If we bear briars and thorns, we are nigh unto curſing,

How many do that, they think leaſt of, and are guilty of that, they once imagine not themſelves to be guilty of: but few of a thouſand will own this guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, and yet as often as they do or have eaten and drunk at this Table unworthily, ſo often they have incurred and renew'd this guilt? Do not they ſay at the laſt day, <hi>When ſaw we thee an hungry or in priſon?</hi> Did the Jews think they pierced their true <hi>Meſsiah?</hi> There are not many Chriſtians in name and profeſſion ſuch, that can be convinced, that they hate and deſpiſe Chriſt as much as the very Jews that crucified him, which yet may be demonſtrate by clear arguments. The Jew honour'd the name of the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> and expected great things of him, and yet hated and rejected him blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; and ſo we call Chriſt Saviour and Lord, and beſprinkle him with ſweet water, but his reign and government over us, we utterly deſpiſe and hate, and prefer a ſordid luſt far before him.</p>

A ſtrange phraſe it is to <hi>eat and drink judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but it is alluſive, and <hi>per mimeſin,</hi> as ſure as he eats of the Bread and drinks of the Cup unworthily, ſo ſure is judgement to follow thereupon, or to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company it, for he eats judgement, but it is to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not to others, except they be partakers in his ſinne, which may be divers ways; So as we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to inſert in all our prayers, Lord forgive our <hi>noſtra aliena,</hi> our other mens ſins, but without partnerſhip in the ſinne we need not fear ſhare in the judgement, He eats it to himſelf; and therefore that argument of the <hi>Donatiſt,</hi> which is riſe now a dayes, <hi>Si corruptis ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaris,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <p>How precious an Ordinance is this Supper, and yet how dangerous? There is life and death ſet before you It's on one ſide a refreſhing cloud, on the other a flaming fire; ſo by the ſame water and way were the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſaved, and the <hi>Aegypians</hi> attempting the like were drown'd: Thus Chriſt alſo is a precious ſtone to believers, a ſtumbling and a cruſhing ſtone to unbelievers, and the Word is a ſavour of life, and a ſavour of death; Some mens eyes are open'd by it, and ſome are ſhut; The ſame Ark is to <hi>Iſrael</hi> a glory, to the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> a ſcourge; Here is honey in the ſame roſe to the Bee, and poyſon to the Spider, and it is according as you eat and drink worthily or unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. We reade in Scripture, that when people cried to Chriſt for cure, uſually he put it upon their faith, <hi>According to your faith,</hi> and, <hi>If thou canst believe;</hi> and we never reade of any one that cried, that he was put by for want of faith; for if they gave never ſo little account, <hi>Lord, I believe, help my unbelief,</hi> it was accepted. The benefit of this Ordinance is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Faith, Repentance, and if you can give but any account of them to God, you may
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:56580:399"/> drink Chriſt out of this Rock, but if you be in ſinnes of love and delight, and come in your wickedneſſe, you take the Sword by the point, not by the haft, and you ſhall ſmart for your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The horrible thunder of the Apoſtle in this place, is not to deterre, but to prepare Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants; An humble ſoul is affrighted with the terrour, and dare not draw nigh this fiery Mount, but it is not ſpoken to affright from the Sacrament, but to enforce a due preparation; When the deſtroying Angel rode his circuit, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> lay ſecure within the line of bloud: This bloud here of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd will protect thee from this condemnation threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if thou flie to it. But</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, The ignorant that are without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the ſcandalous without repentance, who are by the common vote of men excepted againſt, as unfit Communicants, they may know that this is a dreadfull eating and drinking, which is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with ſuch a guiltineſſe, and wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is not envy, malice, or partiality, but it is chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to entreat you not to luſt ſo eagerly after thoſe Quails, which while they are in your mouths, the wrath of God is like to fall upon you, both of you have marks enough of condemnation upon you; Deſire not to adde more, be ſure the King will ſurvey and view his gueſts, you cannot ſcape in the croud; What if you be taken from the Table, and caſt into utter darkneſſe? It concernes me to give you warning; If you take the Allarme, and
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:56580:400"/> firſt labour for knowledge, and ſeeke repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by the means appointed to beget them, and to beget you unto God: Well, If not then, it concernes the Church to ſhew you mercy in making ſtay of you from falling into the fire. For,</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, The eating and drinking of the Lords Bread, and the Lords Cup unworthily, is a ſinne dangerous to Common-wealths and Churches, for it brings judgement, Epidemick judgement, ſo it did upon this Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">

Happy we, if we knew the particular cauſe of Gods angry viſitations, ſinne in the generall we acknowledge, but we owne not our particular ſinnes; We have had many, and great, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calamities, but are fallen from aſſigning them to the abuſe of the Sacrament, and yet we muſt confeſſe that what hath been a doore at which judgements have enter'd may be ſo againe: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, I think, that rationally I may excite pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Authority to reſtraine or to make proviſion of reſtraint for ſuch ſinnes as are pernicious to Commonwealths, in bringing forth publick judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which eat up and conſume the people, and ſuch is this ſinne, as I have ſhowne: I know no Powers can command or compell faith or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace, but it's a ſure fallacy to inferre from thence, that he may not reſtraine ſinnes that bring publick judgements, or not bring the people to the means of faith. It's a ſaying, that a man
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:56580:400"/> cannot make his Horſe drinke without he will, but yet he may have him to the water. God directed the fourth Commandment to Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and Parents, and Maſters, and thereby ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuppoſed they had, or elſe gave them a Power or Commiſſion to ſee the Sabbath kept within their Juriſdictions, not I confeſſe to force the <hi>Ger Toſhab,</hi> or Proſelyte of the gate, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the whole Religion of the Jew, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſeven Commandments, as they call them, given to <hi>Noah,</hi> and not to violate the Sabbath: If he will live among them, he muſt obſerve the Sabbath.</p>

                        <p>For the clearer opening of this point of ſelf-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, I might thus diſtinguiſh, There is a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examination required of all men, of all Chriſtians, of all Communicants.</p>
                        <p>That which is required of all men, is, <hi>To ſearch and try their wayes</hi> in order to converſion or repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>Lam. 3. 40. Let us ſearch and try our ſelves, and turn unto the Lord,</hi> which if diligently done they might know and own their miſery, and finde an abſolute neceſſity of converſion, the want of this is the reaſon that men lie ſo faſt aſleep in ſecurity, and purſue their beloved ſinnes without check or control, <hi>Jer. 8. 6. No man repented him of his wickedneſſe, ſaying, What have I done?</hi> Every one turned to his courſe, <hi>as the horſe ruſheth into the battel;</hi> And how is that? <hi>He mocks at fear, and is not affrighted, He ſaith among the Trumpets, Ha, ha,</hi> Job 39. 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It would take off their edge and metal; If men did but conſider and believe how directly their wayes point toward the eternal damnation of their ſouls. The Rule of this Examination, or the glaſſe which makes this reflexion is the ſevere Law of God which involves all ſinners under a curſe.</p>
                        <p>That which is required of all Chriſtians is to prove their own works, whether they be wrought in God, in order to their own comfort, <hi>Gal. 6. 4. Let every man prove his own work, and ſo ſhall he have rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in himſelf,</hi> And this is the ſweet and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate reward of all ſincere duties, which leave a ſweet
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:56580:404"/> taſte, or ſavour behinde them, <hi>Heb. 11. 5. Enoch</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Tranſlation had this teſtimony that he pleaſed God: This is that reward, which God gives his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before their tranſlation, as firſt-fruits before the harveſt, the unſpeakable comfort of a ſincere duty; Nor only his works, but a Chriſtian is to examine his ſpiritual eſtate, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 5. Whether you be in the faith, Know ye not that Chriſt is in you,</hi> we ſhould not only be, but know we are, and this by examining, The Rule of which examination is the Goſpel, which gives marks and evidences of it.</p>
                        <p>That which is required of all Communicants is, to examine their fitneſſe and meetneſſe, which is their worthineſſe to come and eat at the Lords Table, and the Rule of this Examination is the Ordinance it ſelf, or the inſtitution of it, as I have before ſhew'd, for the graces to be exerciſed in it, and beſpoken by it, are the Rule by which we muſt examine our ſelves, whether we have them in us or no, and this ſelf-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, this particular whereof the Sacrament it ſelf is the Rule, is that I have to inſiſt upon, and therefore I am not bound by the Law of the Text to flie ſo great a compaſſe, as to handle the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place of ſelf-examination in all his latitude, neither will I do it, but onely premiſe certain generall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall poſitions, whereby we may be either mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto, or directed in the performance of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing duty, ſelf-examination, and they are theſe.</p>

One of the firſt works which the Word and Spirit works in men, is to give them a light to go down into the dark cellar of their hearts, and make diſcoveries; then a man begins to be amazed, and tremble at the fight of himſelf. It's ſaid of the loſt ſonne, <hi>Luke 15. that he came to himſelf;</hi> Self-knowledge is the School-miſtreſs of humility; We are proud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know not our ſelves; He that knows not himſelf muſt needs be proud; He that knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf loaths himſelf; He that knows his ſins, ſees neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Chriſt; He that knows his wants, prayes; He that knows his weakneſſe, fears and flies to the Rock; He that brings knowledge of himſelf to a Sermon, gathers out of the garden thoſe herbs that are medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal to him; He that knows his own temptations, avoids the occaſions that uſe to enſnare him; He that knows his own experiences, hopes with patience,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:56580:405"/> when he ſees no light: It's true, the heart is deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and who can know it? But we need not taſte all the water in the Sea to know it to be brackiſh, nor taſte every crab to know the tree; We know the earth well enough, though we never digg'd to the centre; no man is bound to number all his ſinnes or thoughts, God hath taught us, that all a natural mans imaginations are onely evil, continually evil; It's enough to know our ſelves judgingly, ſo farre as may occaſion us to know Chriſt ſavingly, whoſe riches are unſearchable, and cannot throughly be known, and perfectly.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, A man may be deceived in his ſpiritual eſtate all his life time, for want of ſelf-examination in a due manner, by a right Rule we are full of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flattery, and of hypocriſie; we diſguiſe and extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate our ſinnes, we ſet a varniſh and good aſpect on our works and virtues; Before his converſion <hi>Paul</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> thought himſelf alive, and that he was in the right, afterward he cals it, <hi>Confidence in the fleſh.</hi> After a<note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> man comes into the opinion and profeſſion of Chriſt, he may be in the caſe of the Church of <hi>Laodicea, Thou ſayeſt I am rich, and knowest not that thou art naked;</hi> The <hi>Jew</hi> outwardly, thinks he is a <hi>Jew</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; The fooliſh Virgins do not ſee but that they are wiſe. I know there is a Rule of certain diſcerning, but if we put not our ſelves into the ſcales, we may ſeem to our ſelves to be good weight when we are too light. I do not think that all hypocrites are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd to themſelves, which is the ſaddeſt miſtake that can be in the world, never to be convinced, till we hear that word, <hi>Depart, I know ye not;</hi> Not that I think that any ſincere heart, that is willing to come
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:56580:406"/> unto the light, and cries with the <hi>Pſalmist,</hi> Pſal. 139. 23. <hi>Search me, O Lord, and try me,</hi> doth ever periſh in this deceit, for ſuch a one hath Chriſt, and therefore hath life; and we are not ſaved, becauſe we know we have him, but becauſe we have him, Some are in Chriſt, but do not perfectly own it. It's a ſafe errour, but they that think they believe in him and do not, are not ſaved becauſe they think they do, but damned becauſe they do not, and this is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous errour. The Lord put it into your hearts to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your ſelves, and prove your ſelves, the onely way I know to get out of this flattering miſtake.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Men that live in the boſom of the Church, are by nothing more kept out of Chriſt, than the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that they have him already. They have a faith which keeps them from faith, and a believing that holds them faſt in unbelief. D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                           <hi>Whitakers</hi> approves that ſaying of <hi>Melancthon,</hi> That hiſtorical faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely differs from juſtifying faith, and therefore (which I would have obſerved) the <hi>Corinthians</hi> whom the Apoſtle exhorts to examine themſelves, <hi>Whether they were in the faith, whether Christ Jeſus was in them,</hi> were not Heathen <hi>Corinthians,</hi> but the Church, profeſſed Chriſtians already, and ſuch as had a faith of profeſſion, and then that Text will prove, that thoſe that have ſome faith may be in the Apoſtles ſenſe reprobates, becauſe they are not in the faith. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us all, that are profeſſed members of the Church as they were; <hi>Can faith ſave you,</hi> ſaith <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 2. meaning a ſuperficial, opinionative, inoperative faith? Alas he tels you of <hi>believing devils,</hi> that by confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all are damned; Let not this faith keep you from Chriſt, which doth not cloſe you with him, you
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:56580:406"/> may be a graff to the ſtock with a ſtring, but it will not knit and live, becauſe it is not engraffed in: So you may be reputed Chriſtians and believers by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion and agglutination, by that faith you have, but never live ſpiritually or eternally by it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt Jeſus is not in you; All the terrour of the Lord draws no bloud; All invitations of the Goſpel move not, And why? Becauſe you lie under the ſhell and ſhelter of this faith and believing, which defeats the operation both of Law and Goſpel, till God open your eyes to ſee thorow it, and bring you to ſee the need of a Chriſt accepting faith.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, There are but two ſpiritual eſtates, and all men while in this world muſt be in the one or other, not in both at once, and they are uſually known by the names of nature and grace, or as Scripture uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, <hi>darkneſſe and light, death or life;</hi> This is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious Rule, and brings this work of ſelf-examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into a narrow room upon this interrogatory, Art thou in the ſtate of unbelief and unregeneration, or tranſlated into the Kingdom of Chriſt Jeſus? Art thou in the narrow, or in the broad way? There is a great latitude, and many varieties and degrees of men in each of theſe, but from <hi>Rahab</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> from <hi>O ye of little faith,</hi> to <hi>O woman, great is thy faith,</hi> all are under the line of life, and ſo from the beſt flower in natures garden to the ſharpeſt thorn, all under the black line of death; The diſcovery is the ſooner made, becauſe the partition is but into two, goats and ſheep, walking in two ſeveral wayes, to two ſeveral ends: You will ſay, Unto which of theſe will ye reckon them that are <hi>in tranſitu,</hi> as it were, in the birth, in the paſſage? I ſhould ſay, that as we reckon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>he day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:56580:407"/> to the day, and the embryon of a man is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd to humane kinde, and the contracted woman is called wife; ſo though I love not to diſtinguiſh of theſe moments, yet if any day-break of light, any ſeed of faith or good deſires, any little of Chriſt appear in any, I ſhould reckon them to the happier part the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, for they are ſmoaking flax, and bruiſed reeds under the ſweet promiſe of Chriſt, to be blown up, and to be ſtrengthened, and ſo would I have them comfortably in their ſelf-examinations to reckon themſelves: As likewiſe all men in the world may compendiouſly reckon themſelves under ſinne and wrath, and in ſtate of damnation, upon and by the argument, which is the convictive argument of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Joh. 16. 9. All men are under ſinne</hi> that believe not in Chriſt, <hi>Of ſin, becauſe they believe not in me,</hi> and it reaches all the world: Not believing in Chriſt proves every man under ſin, if not <hi>propter infidelitatem,</hi> for their unbelief, therefore <hi>Thomas</hi> and other Schoolmen deny it, as to them, that never heard of Chriſt, yet <hi>ratione infidelitatis</hi> by reaſon of their not believing, <hi>The wrath of God abides upon them,</hi> as all confeſſe, and as the Scripture ſpeaks. Theſe four things may ſerve as motives to this duty of ſelf exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and there are two more that rather look like directions therein.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, The Rule of this ſelf-examination muſt be (according to the properties of a Rule) a known and certain inflexible Rule, that is not partial to or againſt us; for how ſhall we proceed from examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſelves to judge our ſelves, <hi>verſ.</hi> 31. if the proceſſe be not regulated, ſo as the judgement may be true and certain; therefore the word of God muſt be
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:56580:407"/> that Canon or meaſure, by which, if we will not be deceived, we muſt be tried, for that muſt judge us another day; by a falſe ſtandard, or a falſe touchſtone, or falſe rule we diſcern nothing; and therefore when thou goeſt about this work, baniſh all thy own flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering reaſons, all other mens fooliſh and fraudulent comforts and counſels; Let the Word of God ſit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, and ſtand or fall before that Tribunal; Seeſt thou not how the Phariſee flatter'd himſelf, judging himſelf by his own traditional exerciſes? The young man flatter'd himſelf, <hi>All this have I done; Paul</hi> ſhows upon what confidences he flatter'd himſelf, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed every man will be in good eſtate, if he may judge by his own fancy, flattery or conceit, but falſe <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums</hi> beget but fallacies in concluſion, and our ſouls are betray'd and undone by Lesbian rules, a ſincere heart will not ſtand to that teſt, knowing that fleſh and bloud may ſpeak good to me, as the falſe Prophets to <hi>Ahab,</hi> and the word of God ſpeak evil, as <hi>Michaiah</hi> did unto him; God is not pleaſed that any man ſhould bear falſe witneſſe againſt, or for himſelf; We may neither proudly and partially acquit our ſelves upon falſe and flattering perſwaſions, nor on the other hand deny the leaſt evidence of grace, and of the Spirit in our ſelves, wherein the godly do often deſerve blame by ſlighting and undervaluing the work of grace in their hearts; There are proud ſelf complaints as well as ſelf flatteries; The Word is the moſt impartial Judge of our ſtate, or of our actions.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, It's neceſſary to ſtick upon the work of ſelf-examination, untill we bring it to an iſſue, and be able to make a judgement upon our own ſelves, for we are apt to pull off the plaiſter, when it begins to
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:56580:408"/> ſmart before it hath done its work, and are unwilling to ſet up all our reaſonings, and bring them to a <hi>non plus,</hi> and ſo we never know our ſelves, never judge our ſelves; ſometimes a man is Sermon-ſhaken, and his heart begins to tremble, and to queſtion with it ſelf, and if he would but follow the ſtroke he might come to finde out his condition, but he lets the iron cool again, and like <hi>Felix</hi> when he trembled, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes <hi>Paul</hi> till another time; This the Apoſtle ſhews us in theſe words, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 24. he goes away from the <hi>glaſse, and ſtraightway forgets what manner of man he was,</hi> and therefore he ſaith, we muſt look into the glaſſe, and continue therein, reſolving to be deaf to fleſh and bloud, friends, carnal counſels, and by the Rule of the Word to bring the Queſtion to an iſſue, whether <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con,</hi> for us, or againſt as.</p>

                        <p>I have laid down theſe ſix Rules, which are of good uſe, and great ſervice in the examination of our ſelves at all times, or at any time. Now I come to the particular buſineſſe of the Text, which is ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examination in order to our worthy coming to the Lords Table, for that's the work which lies before us; And for your better inſtruction, I ſhall draw down your thoughts in order to the point, by certain conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The Rule of this ſelf-examination is the very Ordinance according to Chriſts Inſtitution hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recited; You ſee the Apoſtle doth not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly number or rehearſe what the graces,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:56580:408"/> or what the requiſites are upon which interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories the examination muſt be made; He ſaith not, Let a man examine himſelf of this, and of that, but <hi>Let a man examine himſelf;</hi> The reaſon is that which I learn from <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> That if the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances<note place="margin">

                           </gap>, as is here made, what ſuch an offer and exhibition of Chriſt his body and bloud unto us, for communion thereof, doth beſpeak and require of us; That frame of ſpirit, thoſe affections, thoſe graces are requiſite unto the Communicant, which what they are hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy deduced from the nature of the Ordinance it ſelf, and by me declared.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. They being known what they are, it follows that a man examine himſelf, whether they be in us, for elſe we cannot come ſuitably to the Ordinance, nor take and eat the body and bloud offer'd to us, the effect and fruit of ſelf-examination being to know our own ſelves, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 5. Whether Christ be in us, Whether we be in the faith;</hi> To know what graces are required, is no point of ſelf-examination, but whether we be in ſome meaſure furniſht with them or no, and by the duty enjoyn'd it is eaſily inferr'd, That a man may know whether he have thoſe graces, for elſe all examination was unprofitable and vain, and known they are by reflexion and inſight into our ſelves, as a man knows his thoughts, his own purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, his meaning, and can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="3">3. Becauſe a man can only then be ſaid to know he hath the graces required, when he doth diſcern and diſtinguiſh them from all counterfeits or ſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are like, therefore is ſelf-examination neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; For as gold hath copper, a counterfeit of it ſelf: ſo have all true graces ſome thing like themſelves, and called by their name, which are not right, but ſome ſlighty ore lying nearer day; As there is a faith called which is not faith, a repentance not repentance, a love of God which is not the love of God, a ſorrow for ſinne which is not godly ſorrow, there is meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, not a grace, but a moral vertue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore examination of our ſelves is both neceſſary and difficult, that we take not <hi>Leah</hi> for <hi>Rachel,</hi> and ſo come to the Lords Table to no more purpoſe than he that goes to the market with a braſſe ſhilling, which he thinks to be good money.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Then we have this priviledge, <hi>And ſo let him eat of this bread,</hi> &amp;c. When we by examination finde that we have, though but a ſeed or ſpawne of thoſe right and genuine graces which are differenced and diſtinguiſht from all ſemblances and counterfeits
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:56580:409"/> which are called by the ſame name; If every faith confeſſing Chriſt were ſaving; If every <hi>nollem factum,</hi> I am ſorry, were true repentance; If every mans ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>dolet,</hi> it grieves me, were godly ſorrow, there are few or none that could be called unworthy, but there is a difference that makes diſtinction between ſemblance and truth, which few do finde in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe they reſt in generals and equivocals. I have in a Sermon upon this point formerly given the Characters of true grace, and need not ſay it over again at this time. Let every man examine the truth of his graces by theſe Characters, and ſo make uſe of this priviledge, <hi>Let him eat</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>And if I might give you the <hi>Iliads</hi> in a nut-ſhell, theſe are the differences and the characters.</p>

                        <p>The Difference between Nature and Grace is,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Nature begins all his actions from, and refers all unto ſelf, pride, profit, pleaſure, glory, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon honeſty of men to men; Grace hath this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, it turns the face of, and ſets a by as on the heart, whereby it intends, aims to ſeek to pleaſe, to know God, and therefore diſcovers that we ſaw not, that emptineſſe of, and enmity to God which is in us; In a word, it ſets up Gods intereſt above ſelf, which nature cannot do.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Between knowledge and knowledge. There is a ſpecial knowledge of God and of the Word, which is large and beautifull, but the character of true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is affection, as the light that's joyn'd with heat
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:56580:410"/> and aſſimilation of a man to that he knows, forming<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. ult.</note> and conforming to the image of God, <hi>We are changed into the ſame image; We ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 1.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Between faith and faith. There is a Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, a Chriſt acknowledging faith, <hi>Alii cogitant pij cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>dunt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Austin,</hi> but the character of true faith is, That it accepts of, and cloſes with Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, both as a Lord and Saviour, and that upon Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terms, to deny ſelf, and take up his Croſs, and be his, and this faith is inſeparable from holineſſe, or a godly life, never to be found in a wicked or unregenerate man.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Between Repentance and Repentance. There is a Repentance like that of <hi>Judas,</hi> full of anguiſh, a tormenting anguiſh of ſpirit; But the character of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto ſalvation, is the riſe of it from godly ſorrow, which feels love, the nature of it is a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſinne no more, but to cleave to God, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it is fruit unto holineſſe; Conviction, contrition, converſion, make it perfect.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Between Love and Love. There is a love of God ariſing from ſelf-love, ſo one Publican loves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as a Benefactour: But the character of true love is, that it riſes from ſenſe of his firſt and ſaving love to us loſt ſinners, and carries us on to deſire him, to delight in him, to have fellowſhip, to be in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him, and to be like him.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Between Deſire and Deſire. There is a deſire of ſalvation to be out of hell, a deſire of grace meerly as a ſign and ſecurity for heaven to eaſe our painfull an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh; But the character of true deſire is ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as well as ſalvation, grace, not meerly for a bridge to heaven, but for Union, Communion and Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with, and unto Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                        <pb n="369" facs="tcp:56580:410"/>
                        <p>I will proceed no further, this is a taſte of what I before delivered; Theſe are the graces of a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant; Theſe are their Differences and Characters; Theſe lead you on to the priviledge granted, <hi>And ſo let him come and eat,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Great Uſe may be made of this point, and the Uſe is rather to be made by you than me, for ſo the Text, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf,</hi> but I will point you to it in a word or two.</p>

I have ſaid enough, to move you, enough to direct you, the benefit is great, the danger great, the means to obtain the benefit to eſcape the danger is this; If you finde ſinne labour to bring repentance; If you need a Saviour, come and take him as freſhly bleeding, but bring thirſt and faith with you; Have an eye to the Serpent on a pole, reſt your ſouls as the Dove did upon this Ark, a crucified Chriſt; but do not deceive your ſouls, by a ſlight performance; Call your lives and wayes to the bar; Examine, judge your ſelves; Do not neglect, becauſe no body ſees you, there is a God will ſearch out your ſinne, and judge alſo; You have great imployments, make opportunity, you are in ſuits, one Ordinance of God doth not diſable another, you may lawfully pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue your right, and yet purſue peace, and keep chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; If you ſuffer wrong, forgive, it's glorious; If you do wrong, <hi>Leave your gift at the Altar, and be reconciled firſt,</hi> that's more glorious; Set apart time, ſet apart your ſelves, Commune with your heart in
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:56580:411"/> your cloſet in ſilence, no man caſts up his accounts in a croud or throng, you need no other buſineſſe while you do this; Seek of God by prayer and faſting a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearching heart, and do it as if ye were to die; make the accounts between God and your ſouls even, and ſequeſter your ſelves to that purpoſe; for ſo when you caſt up your accounts, you uſe to ſhut up your ſhops.</p>
                        <p>2. That Donatiſtical principle of ſeparation from Congregations or Churches, wherein there is a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of worthy and unworthy, doth from hence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome check; for a man is to examine himſelf concerning his fitneſſe, and if he eats unworthily he eats damnation or judgement to himſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a private member hath here no call or warrant to examine the fitneſſe of others, nor do they that are unworthy eat judgement to him, but to themſelves; But of this I have already ſpoken at large.</p>

                           <pb n="371" facs="tcp:56580:411"/>1. I do not enforce it upon this Text, which doth not intend an Examination meerly by propounding Queſtions, but a finding out of our ſpiritual eſtate, and of that whole fitneſſe and meetneſſe required of us in order to our acceſſe to the Lords Table; That in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was an exploration by queſtion, touching know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, competent or ſufficient; This in the Text is required before every Sacrament, that but once in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to firſt Admiſſion, and therefore as I prove it not by this Text, ſo I muſt needs ſay, it is not diſproved by it; And therefore they that infer from hence againſt all Examination by others, muſt neceſſarily deſtroy all catechizing, whether by parents, maſters or others, which cannot be; Every man is bound to examine himſelf, but not bound from examining others that are under his charge, for then he ſhould be bound from his duty, and therefore it holds not negatively, that no man may examine another, and ſo both parts may let this Text reſt.</p>

Therefore in all Goſpel Churches, we may find footſteps of this exploration, look into the <hi>Romiſh</hi> and Popiſh way, they have auricular Confeſſion, which is a mixture of tyranny and ſuperſtition, but the people muſt paſs this teſt, which did not they ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly take for an eaſie way of pardon of ſin, they would be ſenſible of as extream ſlavery; and it's <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus</hi> his obſervation, That this Confeſſion was of old inſtituted <hi>ad hanc probationem,</hi> for this trial or probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mens fitneſs to this Sacrament.

                           <hi>Hooker</hi> to infer and ſay,</p>
                        <p>1. To them that ask for a direct precept or injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:56580:413"/> for this in the New Teſtament: I anſwer, That 'tis a point of order, not of faith; <hi>It's of profitable uſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hooker, not of abſolute neceſsity, for then I muſt be examin'd too, and it would extend to all the world, as well as us, and yet you exact it not at Miniſters hands, nor men of known ſufficiency, Therefore it's not of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity, but of order, I mean not of neceſsity to worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. In ſome caſes profitable; and I muſt tell you we were in a ſingular and particular caſe here in <hi>England;</hi> for you know men and women had been by Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to receive the Sacrament ſo oft in a year, which compulſion, to diſcover Recuſancy, with the neglect of catechizing, brought in a world of people blinde and unworthy, the Remedy and Reformation of which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate abuſe, and the prevention of Separation from our Churches (had no order been appointed) which muſt have univerſally followed by the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the thing, and inſtigation of them that lay on the advantage, were ſuch reaſons as could enforce no leſſe; Nor do I know how poſſibly otherwiſe the matter could be remedied or r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>dreſt, not intended to deſpiſe any that had right before, and had been long admitted.</p>
                        <p>3. The principal thing is, that the end of this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination be obtained, though the form or manner be not punctual, as namely, That a man have competent knowledge of this Ordinance, and be ſo known to have, whether by good teſtimony of others that are able, or by our acquaintance, or by conference, or he is a learned man, a knowing man, a Miniſter of the Word, which may be juſtly preſumed to have due knowledge, as <hi>Paul</hi> preſumed that <hi>Agrippa believed
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:56580:413"/> the Prophets.</hi> I ſay in theſe caſes, the end of Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is attained: Nay, if one ſhould come and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelf by confeſſion of his Chriſtian faith, and purpoſe of life without any Queſtion propounded or asked, I ſhould not ſo dote upon Queſtions and forms of Examination, as not to paſſe ſuch a one for a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, becauſe I have attained the end of all Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, which is, I know, that he hath knowledge competent, not that I would encourage any man to break a wholſom order, or eſtabliſhment; for the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture requires, and the Apoſtle enjoyned to <hi>ſee order in the Church,</hi> Col. 2. 5. But that I would principally intend the thing it ſelf above the form, not denying the right which he hath by his knowledge and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, nor thruſting him upon a ſeparation meerly upon a form, except in one caſe, that a man intend to break a publick order, and to deſtroy it by his example; As if a man tear my hedge upon a juſt occaſion, I take no offence, but if he purpoſe to let all the Swine into my corn, I ſhould oppoſe him.</p>
                        <p>4. I could wiſh that all Examination were bounded and limited to ſuch Queſtions as are of neceſſity to this Sacrament; There were printed ſome few Queſtions and Anſwers, as the rule and bounds of it ſome five or ſix years ſince; For I dare not truſt the diſcretion of all men without a gage; And if any man ſhould ask me ſuch a Queſtion as is not neceſſary, or for a Scholar to know, or to pry into my ſecr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ts, I ſhould, though I could anſwer, crave excuſe. I am afraid of, and terribly hate auricular confeſſion, I love no ſtep toward it, and therefore I would not anſwer upon my own liberty.</p>
                        <p>5. Though ſome will ſay, I can declare my ſelf to
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:56580:414"/> my Miniſter, but not otherwiſe. I confeſs the Paſtour hath the greateſt account to make of his people, and is moſt concerned: But what if the Church will not truſt him with that report, as all Miniſters are not to be truſted with it, ſuch is their looſneſſe in this point, and too much facility? And were I to chuſe, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do it under the eye of witneſſes, eſpecially in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with women, who though in one regard, their modeſty hinders to ſpeak before others, yet in other regards is matter of occaſion to them that are ill mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which muſt needs be avoided, providing things honeſt, not before God but men.</p>
                        <p>6. Laſtly, Let men lay conſcience to the point, and ſet by paſſion and prejudice, both examiner and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and in humility and meeknes deny themſelves, to keep up ſome face of order in theſe broken times; Let your thirſt to this Sacrament carry you thorow a thorn-hedge, and I on the other hand ſhall ſtoop low, rather than a thirſty ſoul ſhould want the Sacrament, or be thruſt on the Rock of Separation, and ſo we ſhall meet at the end, though differ in the way. It ſhould be a very ſorry anſwer indeed, that I would not make the beſt of, and (I hope) you would not make the worſt of any errour or infirmity in me, I know Order in an Army (as he ſayes) kils no body, yet without it they are a Rout, and not an Army.</p>
